  abstract = {Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler distance-a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions-and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics.},

  abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is a key neuronal mechanism. Here, a novel method for quantifying PAC via the Wasserstein distance is presented. The Wasserstein distance is an optimization algorithm for minimizing transportation cost and distance. For the first time, the author has applied this distance function to quantify PAC and named the Wasserstein Modulation Index (wMI). As the wMI accommodates the product of the amplitude value in each phase position and the coupling phase position, it allows for extraction of more detailed PAC features from the data. The validity of the wMI calculations was examined using various simulation data, including sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal waves and empirical data sets. The current findings showed that the wMI is a more robust and stable index for quantifying PAC under various measuring conditions. Specifically, it can better reflect the timing of coupling and distinguish the shape of the coupling distribution than other measurements, both of which are the most significant parameters related to the functionality of PAC. Furthermore, the wMI is also suitable for many applications, such as more data-driven approaches and direct comparisons. Compared with Euler-based PAC methods and the Modulation Index (MI), the wMI is not easily affected by the non-sinusoidal nature of neural oscillation and the short data length and enables better reflection of the natures of PAC, such as the timing of coupling and the amplitude distribution in the phase plane, than the MI. The wMI is expected to extract more detailed PAC characteristics, which could considerably contribute to the neuroscience field.},

  title = {Measuring directionality between neuronal oscillations of different frequencies.},
  author = {Jiang, Haiteng and Bahramisharif, Ali and van Gerven, Marcel A J and Jensen, Ole},

  doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.044},
  abstract = {It is well established that neuronal oscillations at different frequencies interact with each other in terms of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). In particular, the phase of slower oscillations modulates the power of faster oscillations. This is referred to as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Examples are alpha phase to gamma power coupling as observed in humans and theta phase to gamma power coupling as observed in the rat hippocampus. We here ask if the interaction between alpha and gamma oscillations is in the direction of the phase of slower oscillations driving the power of faster oscillations or conversely from the power of faster oscillations driving the phase of slower oscillations. To answer this question, we introduce a new measure to estimate the cross-frequency directionality (CFD). This measure is based on the phase-slope index (PSI) between the phase of slower oscillations and the power envelope of faster oscillations. Further, we propose a randomization framework for statistically evaluating the coupling measures when controlling for multiple comparisons over the investigated frequency ranges. The method was firstly validated on simulated data and next applied to resting state electrocorticography (ECoG) data. These results demonstrate that the method works reliably. In particular, we found that the power envelope of gamma oscillations drives the phase of slower oscillations in the alpha band. This surprising finding is not easily reconcilable with theories suggesting that feedback controlled alpha oscillations modulate feedforward processing reflected in the gamma band.},

  title = {Phase-amplitude coupling of Go/Nogo task-related neuronal oscillation decreases for humans with insufficient sleep.},
  author = {Zhang, Peng and Sun, Chuancai and Liu, Zhongqi and Zhou, Qianxiang},

  journal = {Sleep},
  doi = {10.1093/sleep/zsad243},
  abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) across frequency might be associated with the long-range synchronization of brain networks, facilitating the spatiotemporal integration of multiple cell assemblies for information transmission during inhibitory control. However, sleep problems may affect these cortical information transmissions based on cross-frequency PAC, especially when humans work in environments of social isolation. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the theta-beta/gamma PAC of task-related electroencephalography (EEG) for humans with insufficient sleep. Here, we monitored the EEG signals of 60 healthy volunteers and 18 soldiers in the normal environment, performing a Go/Nogo task. Soldiers also participated in the same test in isolated cabins. These measures demonstrated theta-beta PACs between the frontal and central-parietal, and robust theta-gamma PACs between the frontal and occipital cortex. Unfortunately, these PACs significantly decreased when humans experienced insufficient sleep, which was positively correlated with the behavioral performance of inhibitory control. The evaluation of theta-beta/gamma PAC of Go/Nogo task-related EEG is necessary to help understand the different influences of sleep problems in humans.},
