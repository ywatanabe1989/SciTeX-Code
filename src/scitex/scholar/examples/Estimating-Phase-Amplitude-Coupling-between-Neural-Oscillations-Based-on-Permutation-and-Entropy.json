      "abstract": "Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) plays an important role in neuronal oscillations network, reflecting the interaction between the phase of low-frequency oscillation (LFO) and amplitude of the high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Thus, we applied four methods based on permutation analysis to measure PAC, including multiscale permutation mutual information (MPMI), permutation conditional mutual information (PCMI), symbolic joint entropy (SJE), and weighted-permutation mutual information (WPMI). To verify the ability of these four algorithms, a performance test including the effects of coupling strength, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and data length was evaluated by using simulation data. It was shown that the performance of SJE was similar to that of other approaches when measuring PAC strength, but the computational efficiency of SJE was the highest among all these four methods. Moreover, SJE can also accurately identify the PAC frequency range under the interference of spike noise. All in all, the results demonstrate that SJE is better for evaluating PAC between neural oscillations.",
