  abstract = {Oscillatory activity in the brain has been associated with a wide variety of cognitive processes including decision making, feedback processing, and working memory. The high temporal resolution provided by electroencephalography (EEG) enables the study of variation of oscillatory power and coupling across time. Various forms of neural synchrony across frequency bands have been suggested as the mechanism underlying neural binding. Recently, a considerable amount of work has focused on phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)- a form of cross-frequency coupling where the amplitude of a high frequency signal is modulated by the phase of low frequency oscillations. The existing methods for assessing PAC have some limitations including limited frequency resolution and sensitivity to noise, data length and sampling rate due to the inherent dependence on bandpass filtering. In this paper, we propose a new time-frequency based PAC (t-f PAC) measure that can address these issues. The proposed method relies on a complex time-frequency distribution, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID)-Rihaczek distribution, to estimate both the phase and the envelope of low and high frequency oscillations, respectively. As such, it does not rely on bandpass filtering and possesses some of the desirable properties of time-frequency distributions such as high frequency resolution. The proposed technique is first evaluated for simulated data and then applied to an EEG speeded reaction task dataset. The results illustrate that the proposed time-frequency based PAC is more robust to varying signal parameters and provides a more accurate measure of coupling strength.},
