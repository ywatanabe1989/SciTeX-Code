We are developing this module, SciTeX-Scholar, for scientific literature search.

As an example, I would like to do literature search for ~/proj/gpac/ to write a paper.

Please implement necessary functionalities:
1. Literature search
2. Download PDF files
3. Create a bibtex file
4. Create comparison tables with LLM
4. Detect knowledge gap with LLM
