# Zotero Test Case Extractor Script

This script automates the process of finding and consolidating embedded test cases from a directory of Zotero translator `.js` files. It extracts the content between the `/** BEGIN TEST CASES **/` and `/** END TEST CASES **/` markers and saves it into a single, well-organized text file.

### Configuration

The script has two main configuration variables that you can adjust:

* `TRANSLATORS_DIR`: The path to the directory containing your Zotero `.js` files. The default is set to `./src/scitex/scholar/url/helpers/finders/zotero_translators`.
* `OUTPUT_FILE`: The name of the file where all extracted test cases will be saved. The default is `concatenated_zotero_tests.txt`.

### Script Logic

The script performs the following steps:

1.  **Verify Directory**: It first checks if the `TRANSLATORS_DIR` exists to prevent errors.
2.  **Initialize Output File**: It clears the `OUTPUT_FILE` to ensure that each run starts fresh.
3.  **Find and Loop**: It finds all files ending in `.js` within the specified directory and processes them one by one.
4.  **Extract Test Cases**: For each file, it uses the `sed` command to extract only the text block containing the embedded test cases.
5.  **Format Output**: It adds a header to the output file for each translator, making it easy to see the source of each test case block.

### The Script

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Extract Zotero Test Cases
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script finds all Zotero translator .js files in a specified directory,
# extracts the embedded test case blocks (the content between
# /** BEGIN TEST CASES / and / END TEST CASES **/), and concatenates them
# into a single output file for easy review and processing.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --- Configuration ---
# Set the directory where your Zotero .js files are located.
# This path is relative to where you run the script. Adjust if necessary.
TRANSLATORS_DIR="./src/scitex/scholar/url/helpers/finders/zotero_translators"

# Set the name for the final output file.
OUTPUT_FILE="concatenated_zotero_tests.txt"

# --- Main Script Logic ---
# 1. Verify that the source directory exists.
if [ ! -d "$TRANSLATORS_DIR" ]; then
echo "Error: Source directory not found at '$TRANSLATORS_DIR'"
echo "Please make sure you are running this script from your project's root directory."
exit 1
fi

# 2. Clear the output file to ensure a clean run every time.
echo "Initializing output file: $OUTPUT_FILE"

"$OUTPUT_FILE"

# 3. Find all .js files and loop through them.
echo "Searching for translators in '$TRANSLATORS_DIR'..."
find "$TRANSLATORS_DIR" -name "*.js" | while read -r filepath; do
# 4. Check if the file actually contains a test case block.
if grep -q "/** BEGIN TEST CASES **/" "filepath";then#Getjustthefilenameforcleanerlogging.filename=(basename "$filepath")
echo "  -> Found and extracting test cases from: $filename"

    # 5. Add a header to the output file to identify the source of the tests.
    echo "================================================================================" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
    echo "## Test Cases from: $filename" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
    echo "================================================================================" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
    
    # 6. Use 'sed' to extract the content between the markers and append it.
    sed -n '/\/\*\* BEGIN TEST CASES \*\*\//,/\/\*\* END TEST CASES \*\*\//p' "$filepath" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
    
    # Add a couple of newlines for better readability between blocks.
    echo "" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
    echo "" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
fi

done

echo ""
echo "âœ… Process complete."
echo "All embedded test cases have been extracted into: $OUTPUT_FILE"
```


### How to Use

1.  **Save the Script**: Save the code into a file named `extract_tests.sh`.
2.  **Make it Executable**: In your terminal, run `chmod +x extract_tests.sh`.
3.  **Run**: Execute the script with `./extract_tests.sh`.

After running, the `concatenated_zotero_tests.txt` file will be created in the same directory, containing all the extracted test data.

## Important Translators

While you have over 700 translators, you can achieve excellent coverage by focusing on a smaller, high-impact set. The key is to target the major publishers and the underlying platforms that host thousands of journals.

Here is a prioritized list of the most vital translators to work on for academic purposes.

#### Tier 1: The Core Giants (Must-Haves)
These platforms host a massive percentage of all modern scientific literature. Ensuring these work flawlessly is your top priority.

- ScienceDirect.js: For Elsevier journals.

- Springer Link.js: For Springer content.

- Wiley Online Library.js: For Wiley journals.

- Taylor and Francis+NEJM.js: For Taylor & Francis and the New England Journal of Medicine.

- SAGE Journals.js: For SAGE publications.

#### Tier 2: Major Aggregators & Databases
These are the central hubs where researchers find papers from many different publishers.

- PubMed.js: The essential database for all biomedical research.

- Google Scholar.js: The most widely used academic search engine.

- JSTOR.js: A critical archive for humanities and social sciences.

- arXiv.org.js: The main preprint server for physics, computer science, and math.

- Project MUSE.js: Another key aggregator for humanities and social sciences.

#### Tier 3: High-Impact Publishers & Societies
These are individual publishers that are extremely influential and common.

- Nature Publishing Group.js: For Nature and its associated journals.

- ACS Publications.js: American Chemical Society.

- ACM Digital Library.js: Association for Computing Machinery.

- IEEE Xplore.js: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

- Oxford University Press.js

- Cambridge Core.js

#### Tier 4: Key Platforms & Open Access Hubs
These translators cover platforms that host many journals or are crucial for finding open-access versions.

- HighWire 2.0.js: A platform used by many societies (and for preprint servers like bioRxiv).

- Atypon Journals.js: Another very large platform provider.

- BioMed Central.js and PLoS Journals.js: Major open-access publishers.

By focusing your testing and development efforts on this "vital list" of about 20-25 translators, you will likely cover over 80% of the academic articles your system will need to process.
