## Delivered Features

### Phase 1: Storage Helpers (`LibraryManager.py`)

```python
# Check storage state
has_metadata(paper_id: str) -> bool
has_urls(paper_id: str) -> bool
has_pdf(paper_id: str) -> bool

# Load/save operations
load_paper_from_id(paper_id: str) -> Paper
save_paper_incremental(paper_id: str, paper: Paper) -> None
```

**Purpose**: Enable storage-first architecture where each pipeline stage checks storage before processing.

---

### Phase 2: Single Paper Pipeline (`Scholar.py`)

```python
# Process one paper through complete workflow
process_paper(title=None, doi=None, project=None) -> Paper
process_paper_async(title=None, doi=None, project=None) -> Paper
```

**Features**:
- Accepts **title OR doi** as input
- Resolves DOI from title using ScholarEngine
- Sequential stages with storage checks
- Fully resumable (idempotent)
- Saves after each stage

**Pipeline Stages**:
```
Stage 0: Resolve DOI from title (if needed)
Stage 1: Load/create Paper from storage
Stage 2: Find PDF URLs → save to storage
Stage 3: Download PDF → save to storage
Stage 4: Update project symlinks
```

---

### Phase 3: Parallel Papers Pipeline (`Scholar.py`)

```python
# Process multiple papers with controlled parallelism
process_papers(papers, project=None, max_concurrent=3) -> Papers
process_papers_async(papers, project=None, max_concurrent=3) -> Papers
```

**Features**:
- Accepts **Papers collection** or **List[str] of DOIs**
- Parallel papers with semaphore control
- Each paper runs sequential stages independently
- Controlled concurrency via `max_concurrent` parameter

**Architecture**:
```
Paper 1: [Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4]  ┐
Paper 2: [Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4]  ├─ Parallel
Paper 3: [Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4]  ┘
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Storage-First Approach
- **Check storage before each stage** - Avoid duplicate work
- **Save after each stage** - Atomic updates, resumable
- **Single source of truth** - No separate cache, storage IS the state

### 2. Sequential Stages per Paper
- **Simple** - Easy to debug and understand
- **Predictable** - Clear progress tracking
- **Reliable** - No stage interdependencies or race conditions

### 3. Parallel Papers (Optional)
- **Faster** - Process multiple papers concurrently
- **Controlled** - Semaphore limits concurrent operations
- **Flexible** - `max_concurrent=1` for sequential, `=3` for parallel

### 4. Flexible Input
- **Title** - Resolves DOI via ScholarEngine
- **DOI** - Direct processing (faster)
- **Papers collection** - Batch processing
- **DOI list** - Simple string list

---

## Usage Examples

### Single Paper

```python
from scitex.scholar.core.Scholar import Scholar

# Initialize
scholar = Scholar(project="pac", browser_mode="stealth")

# With DOI (direct, faster)
paper = scholar.process_paper(doi="10.1038/s41598-017-02626-y")

# With title (resolves DOI first)
paper = scholar.process_paper(
    title="Epileptic seizure forecasting with long short-term memory neural networks"
)

# Paper now has:
# - Resolved DOI
# - PDF URLs found
# - PDF downloaded (if successful)
# - Saved to library/MASTER/{ID}/
# - Symlinked in project directory
```

### Multiple Papers

```python
# From BibTeX file
papers = scholar.load_bibtex("neurovista.bib")

# Process with parallelism
processed = scholar.process_papers(papers, max_concurrent=3)

# Or sequential
processed = scholar.process_papers(papers, max_concurrent=1)

# From DOI list
dois = ["10.1038/...", "10.1016/...", "10.1109/..."]
processed = scholar.process_papers(dois, max_concurrent=3)
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Engine Name Property Conflicts
- **Issue**: Base class had `name` as @property but `__init__` tried to set it
- **Fix**: Removed `self.name = ...` from all engine __init__ methods
- **Impact**: Engines now work correctly

### 2. OpenURL Fallback for Open Access
- **Issue**: OpenURL returns None for arXiv/open access papers
- **Fix**: Fallback to direct DOI URL when OpenURL fails
- **Impact**: arXiv and other open access papers now find PDF URLs

### 3. PDF Downloader CLI Bug
- **Issue**: Tried to call `.get()` on List instead of Dict
- **Fix**: Proper iteration over List[Dict] to extract URLs
- **Impact**: CLI now works correctly

### 4. Chrome PDF Viewer Type Safety
- **Issue**: Type concatenation errors in error messages
- **Fix**: Added explicit str() conversions for all variables
- **Impact**: Better error handling, prevents crashes

- Manual download fallback works as safety net
- Some publishers require manual intervention

⚠️ **Authentication**
- OpenURL timeout for complex redirect chains (Elsevier)
- Works but may take 15-20 seconds for some publishers

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **PDF Download Robustness**
   - Debug remaining Chrome PDF viewer edge cases
   - Improve download strategy selection
   - Add retry logic for failed downloads

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize authentication (reuse sessions)
   - Cache DOI resolutions
   - Parallel URL finding for batches

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Better handling of paywalled/unavailable papers
   - Skip and continue for problematic papers
   - Generate summary report of failures

## Conclusion

**All three phases successfully implemented and deployed!**

The pipeline provides a **solid foundation** for:
- Processing individual papers from title or DOI
- Batch processing Papers collections
- Storage-first resumable workflows
- Flexible parallel/sequential processing

The architecture is **clean, modular, and extensible** for future enhancements.
