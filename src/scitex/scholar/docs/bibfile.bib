  abstract = {In this study, we present a novel biomimetic deep learning network for epileptic spasms and seizure prediction and compare its performance with state-of-the-art conventional machine learning models. Our proposed model incorporates modular Volterra kernel convolutional networks and bidirectional recurrent networks in combination with the phase amplitude cross-frequency coupling features derived from scalp EEG. They are applied to the standard CHB-MIT dataset containing focal epilepsy episodes as well as two other datasets from the Montefiore Medical Center and the University of California Los Angeles that provide data of patients experiencing infantile spasm (IS) syndrome. Overall, in this study, the networks can produce accurate predictions (100\%) and significant detection latencies (10 min). Furthermore, the biomimetic network outperforms conventional ones by producing no false positives. Biomimetic neural networks utilize extensive knowledge about processing and learning in the electrical networks of the brain. Predicting seizures in adults can improve their quality of life. Epileptic spasms in infants are part of a particular seizure type that needs identifying when suspicious behaviors are noticed in babies. Predicting epileptic spasms within a given time frame (the prediction horizon) suggests their existence and allows an epileptologist to flag an EEG trace for future review.},

  abstract = {Understanding changes in brain rhythms provides useful information to predict the onset of a seizure and to localize its onset zone in epileptic patients. Brain rhythms dynamics in general, and phase-amplitude coupling in particular, are known to be drastically altered during epileptic seizures. However, the neural processes that take place before a seizure are not well understood. We analysed the phase-amplitude coupling dynamics of stereoelectroencephalography recordings (30 seizures, 5 patients) before and after seizure onset. Electrodes near the seizure onset zone showed higher phase-amplitude coupling. Immediately before the beginning of the seizure, phase-amplitude coupling dropped to values similar to the observed in electrodes far from the seizure onset zone. Thus, our results bring accurate information to detect epileptic events during pre-ictal periods and to delimit the zone of seizure onset in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.},

  abstract = {High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be spontaneously generated by seizure-onset and functionally-important areas. We determined if consideration of the spectral frequency bands of coupled slow-waves could distinguish between epileptogenic and physiological HFOs. We studied a consecutive series of 13 children with focal epilepsy who underwent extraoperative electrocorticography. We measured the occurrence rate of HFOs during slow-wave sleep at each electrode site. We subsequently determined the performance of HFO rate for localization of seizure-onset sites and undesirable detection of nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites defined by neurostimulation. We likewise determined the predictive performance of modulation index: MI(XHz)\&(YHz), reflecting the strength of coupling between amplitude of HFOsXHz and phase of slow-waveYHz. The predictive accuracy was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) on receiver-operating characteristics analysis. Increase in HFO rate localized seizure-onset sites (AUC⩾0.72; p<0.001), but also undesirably detected nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC⩾0.58; p<0.001). Increase in MI(HFOs)\&(3-4Hz) also detected both seizure-onset (AUC⩾0.74; p<0.001) and nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC⩾0.59; p<0.001). Increase in subtraction-MIHFOs [defined as subtraction of MI(HFOs)\&(0.5-1Hz) from MI(HFOs)\&(3-4Hz)] localized seizure-onset sites (AUC⩾0.71; p<0.001), but rather avoided detection of nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC⩽0.42; p<0.001). Our data suggest that epileptogenic HFOs may be coupled with slow-wave3-4Hz more preferentially than slow-wave0.5-1Hz, whereas physiologic HFOs with slow-wave0.5-1Hz more preferentially than slow-wave3-4Hz during slow-wave sleep. Further studies in larger samples are warranted to determine if consideration of the spectral frequency bands of slow-waves coupled with HFOs can positively contribute to presurgical evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Attention is a core cognitive mechanism that allows the brain to allocate limited resources depending on current task demands. A number of frontal and posterior parietal cortical areas, referred to collectively as the fronto-parietal attentional control network, are engaged during attentional allocation in both humans and non-human primates. Numerous studies have examined this network in the human brain using various neuroimaging and scalp electrophysiological techniques. However, little is known about how these frontal and parietal areas interact dynamically to produce behavior on a fine temporal (sub-second) and spatial (sub-centimeter) scale. We addressed how human fronto-parietal regions control visuospatial attention on a fine spatiotemporal scale by recording electrocorticography (ECoG) signals measured directly from subdural electrode arrays that were implanted in patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic foci. Subjects (n = 8) performed a spatial-cuing task, in which they allocated visuospatial attention to either the right or left visual field and detected the appearance of a target. We found increases in high gamma (HG) power (70-250 Hz) time-locked to trial onset that remained elevated throughout the attentional allocation period over frontal, parietal, and visual areas. These HG power increases were modulated by the phase of the ongoing delta/theta (2-5 Hz) oscillation during attentional allocation. Critically, we found that the strength of this delta/theta phase-HG amplitude coupling predicted reaction times to detected targets on a trial-by-trial basis. These results highlight the role of delta/theta phase-HG amplitude coupling as a mechanism for sub-second facilitation and coordination within human fronto-parietal cortex that is guided by momentary attentional demands.},

  abstract = {High frequency oscillations have been proposed as a clinically useful biomarker of seizure generating sites. We used a unique set of human microelectrode array recordings (four patients, 10 seizures), in which propagating seizure wavefronts could be readily identified, to investigate the basis of ictal high frequency activity at the cortical (subdural) surface. Sustained, repetitive transient increases in high gamma (80-150 Hz) amplitude, phase-locked to the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm, correlated with strong multi-unit firing bursts synchronized across the core territory of the seizure. These repetitive high frequency oscillations were seen in recordings from subdural electrodes adjacent to the microelectrode array several seconds after seizure onset, following ictal wavefront passage. Conversely, microelectrode recordings demonstrating only low-level, heterogeneous neural firing correlated with a lack of high frequency oscillations in adjacent subdural recording sites, despite the presence of a strong low-frequency signature. Previously, we reported that this pattern indicates a failure of the seizure to invade the area, because of a feedforward inhibitory veto mechanism. Because multi-unit firing rate and high gamma amplitude are closely related, high frequency oscillations can be used as a surrogate marker to distinguish the core seizure territory from the surrounding penumbra. We developed an efficient measure to detect delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations based on cross-frequency coupling between high gamma amplitude and the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm. When applied to the broader subdural recording, this measure consistently predicted the timing or failure of ictal invasion, and revealed a surprisingly small and slowly spreading seizure core surrounded by a far larger penumbral territory. Our findings thus establish an underlying neural mechanism for delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations, and provide a practical, efficient method for using them to identify the small ictal core regions. Our observations suggest that it may be possible to reduce substantially the extent of cortical resections in epilepsy surgery procedures without compromising seizure control.},
