Python

Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
# pip install playwright
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

# scraping browser connection URL
connection_url = "wss://browser.zenrows.com?apikey=YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY"

async def scrape_asyncr_async():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # connect to the scraping browser
        browser = await p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(connection_url)
        context = browser.contexts[0] if browser.contexts else await browser.new_context()
        page = await context.new_page()
        
        await page.goto('https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/')
        print(await page.title())
        
        await browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(scrape_asyncr_async())

Copy

Ask AI
# pip install playwright
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

# scraping browser connection URL
connection_url = "wss://browser.zenrows.com?apikey=YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY"

async def scrape_asyncr_async(url):
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # connect to the scraping browser
        browser = await p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(connection_url)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        
        try:
            await page.goto(url)
            
            # extract the desired data
            await page.wait_for_selector(".product")
            products = await page.query_selector_all(".product")
            data = []
            
            for product in products:
                name = await product.query_selector(".product-name")
                price = await product.query_selector(".price")
                product_url = await product.query_selector(".woocommerce-LoopProduct-link")
                
                data.append({
                    "name": await name.text_content() or "",
                    "price": await price.text_content() or "",
                    "productURL": await product_url.get_attribute("href") or "",
                })
            
            return data
        except Exception as error:
            return error
        finally:
            await page.close()
            await browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = "https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/"
    products = asyncio.run(scrape_asyncr_async(url))
    print(products)
â€‹

Quick Migration from WebSocket URL
If you have existing Playwright code using the WebSocket connection, migrating to the SDK requires minimal changes:
Before (WebSocket URL):
Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const connectionURL = 'wss://browser.zenrows.com?apikey=YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY';

const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(connectionURL);
After (SDK):
Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const { ScrapingBrowser } = require('@zenrows/browser-sdk');

const scrapingBrowser = new ScrapingBrowser({ apiKey: 'YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY' });
const connectionURL = scrapingBrowser.getConnectURL();
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(connectionURL);
â€‹
Complete Example with SDK
Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
// npm install @zenrows/browser-sdk playwright
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const { ScrapingBrowser } = require('@zenrows/browser-sdk');

const scrape_asyncr_async = async () => {
    // Initialize SDK
    const scrapingBrowser = new ScrapingBrowser({ apiKey: 'YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY' });
    const connectionURL = scrapingBrowser.getConnectURL();
    
    const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(connectionURL);
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    
    await page.goto('https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/');
    console.log(await page.title());
    
    await browser.close();
};

scrape_asyncr_async();

How Playwright with Scraping Browser Helps
Combining Playwright with ZenRowsâ€™ Scraping Browser provides powerful advantages for web scraping:
â€‹
Key Benefits
Cloud-based browser instances: Run Playwright scripts on remote Chrome instances, freeing up local resources for other tasks.
Seamless integration: Connect your existing Playwright code to ZenRows with just a WebSocket URL change - no complex setup required.
Advanced automation: Use Playwrightâ€™s full feature set, which includes page interactions, form submissions, file uploads, and complex user workflows.
Built-in anti-detection: Benefit from residential proxy rotation and genuine browser fingerprints automatically.
Cross-browser support: While we use Chromium for optimal compatibility, Playwrightâ€™s API remains consistent across different browser engines.
High concurrency: Scale your Playwright scripts with up to 150 concurrent browser instances, depending on your plan.
Reliable execution: Cloud infrastructure ensures consistent performance without local browser management overhead.
â€‹
Troubleshooting
Below are common issues you might encounter when using Playwright with the Scraping Browser:
1
Connection Refused

If you receive a Connection Refused error, it might be due to:
API Key Issues: Verify that youâ€™re using the correct API key.
Network Issues: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.
WebSocket Endpoint: Ensure that the WebSocket URL (wss://browser.zenrows.com) is correct.
2
Empty Data or Timeout Errors

Use page.waitForSelector() to ensure elements load before extraction
Increase timeout values for slow-loading pages
scrape_asyncr_async.js

Copy

Ask AI
await page.goto('https://example.com', { timeout: 60000 });  // 60 seconds
Verify CSS selectors are correct using browser developer tools
Add page.waitForLoadState('networkidle') for dynamic content
3
Browser Context Issues

Use existing context when available: browser.contexts[0] if browser.contexts else await browser.new_context()
Properly close pages and browsers to prevent resource leaks
Handle exceptions properly to ensure cleanup occurs
4
Geolocation Blocks

Although ZenRows rotates IPs, some websites may block them based on location. Try adjusting the region or country settings.
For more information, check our Scraping Browser Region Documentation and Country Documentation.
