could you explain cookie transfer implementation?




Show thinking
Yes, cookie transfer is the key to making the hybrid approach work. The implementation involves extracting the cookies from your local authenticated browser session and forwarding them with your API request.

Here‚Äôs how you would implement it within your Playwright script.

The 3-Step Process for Cookie Transfer
The entire process happens inside the handle_route function, which intercepts the browser's request to the publisher.

1. Get Cookies from the Playwright Context
First, you need to get all the cookies that your browser has accumulated during the authentication and redirection process. Playwright's context.cookies() method returns a list of cookie dictionaries.

Python

# This code goes inside your handle_route function
cookies_list = await route.request.context.cookies()
Each cookie in cookies_list is a dictionary containing keys like name, value, domain, and path.

2. Format Cookies into an HTTP String
Next, you must convert this list of dictionaries into a single semicolon-separated string, which is the standard format for the Cookie HTTP header. This is the format that APIs like ZenRows expect.

Python

# This code also goes inside handle_route
cookie_string = "; ".join([f"{c['name']}={c['value']}" for c in cookies_list])
3. Send Cookies with the API Request
Finally, you pass this formatted cookie_string to the ZenRows API using their custom_cookies parameter. ZenRows will then attach these cookies to the request it makes to the publisher's website.

Complete Code Example
Here is the complete, practical implementation within the handle_route function we discussed earlier.

Python

import aiohttp
from playwright.async_api import Route

async def handle_route(route: Route):
    """
    Intercepts network requests, forwarding publisher requests to ZenRows
    with authentication cookies.
    """
    request_url = route.request.url
    
    # Define publisher domains to intercept
    publisher_domains = ["nature.com", "sciencedirect.com", "wiley.com", "science.org"]
    
    # Check if the request is for a publisher
    if not any(domain in request_url for domain in publisher_domains):
        await route.continue_()
        return

    print(f"‚úÖ Intercepting authenticated request to: {request_url}")

    # Step 1: Get cookies from the current browser context
    cookies_list = await route.request.context.cookies()

    # Step 2: Format the cookies into an HTTP-compatible string
    cookie_string = "; ".join([f"{c['name']}={c['value']}" for c in cookies_list])

    zenrows_api_key = "YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY"
    params = {
        "url": request_url,
        "apikey": zenrows_api_key,
        "js_render": "true",
        "premium_proxy": "true",
        "custom_cookies": cookie_string,  # Step 3: Add the cookie string to the API call
    }
    
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get("https://api.zenrows.com/v1/", params=params) as response:
                if response.status == 200:
                    print("‚úÖ ZenRows successfully fetched the page with your session.")
                    # Fulfill the local browser's request with the response from ZenRows
                    await route.fulfill(
                        status=response.status,
                        headers=dict(response.headers),
                        body=await response.read()
                    )
                else:
                    print(f"‚ùå ZenRows API failed with status {response.status}")
                    await route.abort()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error during ZenRows proxy request: {e}")
        await route.abort()

# You would register this function before the navigation that needs it:
# await page.context.route("**/*", handle_route)
# await page.click("text=View Full Text") # This click triggers the interception
# await page.context.unroute("**/*", handle_route)
By following these steps, you effectively transfer the authenticated session from your local browser to the remote ZenRows scraper, allowing it to access the paywalled content on your behalf.


I think we should implement step by step; for exmaple, is it possible to check authentication is valid using zenrows mechanism from our cookie info? for example, this page will be automatically redirected if authentication recognized



https://my.openathens.net/?passiveLogin=false

Yes, that's an excellent idea and a perfect use case for an API like ZenRows. You can absolutely use it to perform a quick, headless check to see if your saved authentication cookies are still valid.

This is much more efficient than launching a full local browser instance just for validation.

How It Works
The logic is exactly as you described. You'll tell the ZenRows API to visit the OpenAthens login page and provide your saved session cookies.

If the cookies are valid, the OpenAthens server will recognize the session and automatically redirect to the authenticated "My Account" page.

If the cookies are invalid or expired, the server will either stay on the login page or redirect to one.

By checking the final URL or the page content returned by ZenRows, you can determine if the authentication was successful.

Python Implementation
Here is a complete, self-contained async function that demonstrates how to implement this authentication check using ZenRows.

Python

import asyncio
import json
from pathlib import Path
import aiohttp
import os

async def check_auth_with_zenrows(
    cookie_cache_path: Path,
    zenrows_api_key: str
) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if saved OpenAthens cookies are valid using the ZenRows API.

    Args:
        cookie_cache_path: Path to the JSON file containing saved session cookies.
        zenrows_api_key: Your ZenRows API key.

    Returns:
        True if authentication is successful, False otherwise.
    """
    if not cookie_cache_path.exists():
        print(f"‚ùå Cookie cache not found at: {cookie_cache_path}")
        return False

    # 1. Load and format the cookies from your cache file
    try:
        with open(cookie_cache_path, "r") as f:
            cache_data = json.load(f)
        
        cookies_list = cache_data.get("full_cookies", [])
        if not cookies_list:
            print("‚ùå No cookies found in the cache file.")
            return False
        
        cookie_string = "; ".join([f"{c['name']}={c['value']}" for c in cookies_list])
        print(f"üç™ Loaded {len(cookies_list)} cookies for validation.")

    except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError) as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error reading cookie file: {e}")
        return False

    # 2. Prepare the API request to ZenRows
    # Target URL that should redirect if authenticated
    target_url = "https://my.openathens.net/?passiveLogin=false"
    
    params = {
        "url": target_url,
        "apikey": zenrows_api_key,
        "js_render": "true",          # Important for redirects
        "premium_proxy": "true",      # Use reliable proxies
        "custom_cookies": cookie_string,
    }

    # 3. Make the API call and analyze the response
    print(f"üì° Sending validation request to ZenRows for {target_url}...")
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get("https://api.zenrows.com/v1/", params=params, timeout=45) as response:
                if response.status != 200:
                    print(f"‚ùå ZenRows API failed with status {response.status}")
                    return False

                html_content = await response.text()

                # 4. Check for signs of successful authentication
                # A successful login redirects to '/account' or '/app'
                # and contains text like "Your account" or "Log out".
                success_keywords = ["your account", "log out", "sign out"]
                failure_keywords = ["sign in", "login", "enter your email"]
                
                content_lower = html_content.lower()

                if any(keyword in content_lower for keyword in success_keywords) and \
                   not any(keyword in content_lower for keyword in failure_keywords):
                    print("‚úÖ Authentication successful. Cookies are valid.")
                    return True
                else:
                    print("‚ùå Authentication failed. Cookies are likely expired or invalid.")
                    return False

    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print("‚ùå Request to ZenRows timed out.")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return False

# --- Example Usage ---
async def main():
    # Path to your OpenAthens session file
    # Replace with the actual path generated by your CacheManager
    email_hash = "ee80fdc8" # Example hash
    cache_file = Path.home() / f".scitex/scholar/user_{email_hash}/openathens_session.json"
    
    api_key = os.getenv("ZENROWS_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        print("Please set the ZENROWS_API_KEY environment variable.")
        return
        
    await check_auth_with_zenrows(cookie_cache_path=cache_file, zenrows_api_key=api_key)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Why This Is a Good Approach
Fast and Lightweight: You avoid launching a local browser, which saves system resources and time.

Protects Your IP: Even your validation checks are routed through the ZenRows proxy network, preventing your IP from being flagged for suspicious activity.

Reliable: It's a true end-to-end test that confirms your cookies are accepted by the live OpenAthens server.
