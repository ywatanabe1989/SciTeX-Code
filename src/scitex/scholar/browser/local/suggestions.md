you can absolutely achieve this in Python. The approach involves combining two types of libraries:

A screenshot and GUI automation library: This library will allow your script to take screenshots of the screen, and then control the mouse and keyboard to perform actions like clicking, typing, and dragging.

An OCR library: This library will be used to "read" the text from the screenshots.

Here is a common and effective combination of Python libraries for this purpose:

The Tools
PyAutoGUI: This is the go-to library for GUI automation in Python. It can move the mouse, click, type on the keyboard, and most importantly, take screenshots of the entire screen or a specific region. It's the "click and fill" part of your workflow.

Pillow (PIL): PyAutoGUI uses this library to handle image files, so it's a necessary dependency. It's used for opening, manipulating, and saving screenshots.

PyTesseract: This is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR Engine. It's extremely popular and effective for converting text from images into strings. This is the "OCR" part of your workflow. You will need to install the Tesseract OCR engine on your system separately from the Python library.

The Workflow in Python
A typical workflow using these libraries would look like this:

Take a Screenshot: Use pyautogui.screenshot() to capture the relevant part of the screen where you expect the text to be. It's often more efficient to capture a small region rather than the entire screen.

Perform OCR: Pass the captured image to pytesseract.image_to_string(). This will return a string of all the text found in that image.

Process the Text: Now that you have the text as a string, you can use standard Python string manipulation to search for a specific keyword or pattern (e.g., "Invoice Number:", "Submit").

Find the Coordinates: Many OCR libraries, including PyTesseract, can return not just the text but also the bounding boxes (coordinates) of where that text was found on the image. You can use this to get the (x, y) location of your target text.

Perform an Action:

Once you have the coordinates of the target text (e.g., a button), you can use pyautogui.click(x, y) to click it.

If you need to fill a form field next to a label, you can use the coordinates of the label as a reference point. For example, if the label "Name:" is at (200, 300), you might then use pyautogui.click(200 + 150, 300) to click an input field to its right.

Then, you can use pyautogui.write("My Text Here") to type into the field.

A Simple Code Example
Here is a conceptual example to illustrate the process:

Python

import pyautogui
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# IMPORTANT: You must install the Tesseract executable and set its path
# pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe' 
# (Uncomment and set your path if needed)

# 1. Take a screenshot of a specific region
# Let's assume the area of interest is from (100, 100) to (500, 500)
screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot(region=(100, 100, 500, 500))

# 2. Perform OCR on the screenshot to find all text
text_data = pytesseract.image_to_data(screenshot, output_type=pytesseract.Output.DICT)

# 3. Search for a specific word and get its coordinates
search_word = "Submit"
found = False
for i, word in enumerate(text_data['text']):
    if word == search_word:
        x, y, w, h = (text_data['left'][i], 
                      text_data['top'][i], 
                      text_data['width'][i], 
                      text_data['height'][i])
        
        # Calculate the center of the word relative to the screenshot region
        center_x = 100 + x + w / 2
        center_y = 100 + y + h / 2
        
        print(f"Found '{search_word}' at coordinates: ({center_x}, {center_y})")
        
        # 4. Use PyAutoGUI to click the found location
        pyautogui.click(center_x, center_y)
        found = True
        break

if not found:
    print(f"'{search_word}' was not found on the screen.")
This combination is a powerful and flexible way to automate tasks that are difficult for traditional browser automation tools, as it works by "seeing" and "interacting" with the screen like a human user would.
