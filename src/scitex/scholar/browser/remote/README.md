‚óè Good question! Let me analyze the differences to help you decide:

  Do we need _ZenRowsAPIClient.py?

  Yes, keep it if you need:

  1. Guaranteed country routing
    - API mode 100% supports proxy_country='au'
    - WebSocket/Scraping Browser country support is experimental
  2. Simple HTTP requests without browser overhead
    - Faster for basic GET/POST requests
    - Lower resource usage
    - Better for high-volume, simple scraping
  3. Precise cost control
    - You know exactly what each request costs
    - Can disable features (JS rendering, premium proxy) per request
  4. No browser complexity
    - No page objects, no async context managers
    - Just simple request/response

  No, you can remove it if:

  1. All your use cases need browser interaction
    - Clicking buttons, filling forms, handling popups
    - Complex JavaScript sites
  2. Country routing isn't critical
    - The Scraping Browser seems to work without specific country control
    - Your IPs just need to be residential, not location-specific
  3. You want to simplify the codebase
    - One less module to maintain
    - Scraping Browser can handle most scenarios

  My Recommendation:

  Keep both because they serve different purposes:

  # Use Scraping Browser for complex sites
  if needs_javascript_interaction:
      manager = ZenRowsRemoteBrowserManager()
      browser = await manager.get_browser()

  # Use API Client for simple requests with country needs  
  elif needs_specific_country:
      client = ZenRowsAPIClient(default_country='au')
      response = client.request(url)

  # Use regular browser for debugging
  else:
      manager = BrowserManager()

  But if you want to simplify and your academic use cases mostly need browser interaction, you could remove
  _ZenRowsAPIClient.py and just note in documentation that country-specific routing requires the API mode.
