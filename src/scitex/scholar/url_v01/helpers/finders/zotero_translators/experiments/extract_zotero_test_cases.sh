# Extract Zotero Test Cases
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script finds all Zotero translator .js files in a specified directory,
# extracts the embedded test case blocks (the content between
# /** BEGIN TEST CASES **/ and /** END TEST CASES **/), and concatenates them
# into a single output file for easy review and processing.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Configuration ---

# Set the directory where your Zotero .js files are located.
# This path is relative to where you run the script. Adjust if necessary.
TRANSLATORS_DIR="./src/scitex/scholar/url/helpers/finders/zotero_translators"

# Set the name for the final output file.

# 1. Verify that the source directory exists.

# 2. Clear the output file to ensure a clean run every time.
echo "Initializing output file: $OUTPUT_FILE"

# 3. Find all .js files and loop through them.

        # Get just the filename for cleaner logging.
        filename=$(basename "$filepath")
        echo "  -> Found and extracting test cases from: $filename"

        echo "## Test Cases from: $filename" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
