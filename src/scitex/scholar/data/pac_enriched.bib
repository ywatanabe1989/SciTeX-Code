  abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising construct to study cognitive processes in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetencephalography (MEG). Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures – phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) – and of the generalized linear modeling cross-frequency coupling (GLM-CFC) method is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all four indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all four indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the MVL was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, only the MI and GLM-CFC can detect biphasic coupling. Coupling values of all four indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The MI was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the MI for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the MVL is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a biologically plausible generative model and inference scheme that is capable of simulating communication between synthetic subjects who talk to each other. Building on active inference formulations of dyadic interactions, we simulate linguistic exchange to explore generative models that support dialogues. These models employ high-order interactions among abstract (discrete) states in deep (hierarchical) models. The sequential nature of language processing mandates generative models with a particular factorial structure-necessary to accommodate the rich combinatorics of language. We illustrate linguistic communication by simulating a synthetic subject who can play the 'Twenty Questions' game. In this game, synthetic subjects take the role of the questioner or answerer, using the same generative model. This simulation setup is used to illustrate some key architectural points and demonstrate that many behavioural and neurophysiological correlates of linguistic communication emerge under variational (marginal) message passing, given the right kind of generative model. For example, we show that theta-gamma coupling is an emergent property of belief updating, when listening to another.},

In particular, the strength of phase-amplitude CFC differs across brain areas in a task-relevant manner, changes quickly in response to sensory, motor and cognitive events, and correlates with performance in learning tasks. Importantly, whereas high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC might thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

  abstract = {<jats:p> Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback–Leibler distance—a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions—and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics. </jats:p>},

  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling is a phenomenon observed in several neurological processes, where the phase of one signal modulates the amplitude of another signal with a distinct frequency. The modulation index (MI) is a common technique used to quantify this interaction by assessing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a uniform distribution and the empirical conditional distribution of amplitudes with respect to the phases of the observed signals. The uniform distribution is an ideal representation that is expected to appear under the absence of coupling. However, it does not reflect the statistical properties of coupling values caused by random chance. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for evaluating the significance of an observed MI value based on a null hypothesis that a MI value can be entirely explained by chance. Significance is obtained by comparing the value with a reference distribution derived under the null hypothesis of independence (i.e., no coupling) between signals. We derived a closed-form distribution of this null model, resulting in a scaled beta distribution. To validate the efficacy of our proposed framework, we conducted comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, assessing the significance of MI values under various experimental scenarios, including amplitude modulation, trains of spikes, and sequences of high-frequency oscillations. Furthermore, we corroborated the reliability of our model by comparing its statistical significance thresholds with reported values from other research studies conducted under different experimental settings. Our method offers several advantages such as meta-analysis reliability, simplicity and computational efficiency, as it provides p-values and significance levels without resorting to generating surrogate data through sampling procedures.},

We apply these methods to rhythms simulated with different generative mechanisms and demonstrate inconsistency in phase estimates across the different methods.

To verify the ability of these four algorithms, a performance test including the effects of coupling strength, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and data length was evaluated by using simulation data. It was shown that the performance of SJE was similar to that of other approaches when measuring PAC strength, but the computational efficiency of SJE was the highest among all these four methods.

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Oscillatory activity in the brain has been associated with a wide variety of cognitive processes including decision making, feedback processing, and working memory. The high temporal resolution provided by electroencephalography (EEG) enables the study of variation of oscillatory power and coupling across time. Various forms of neural synchrony across frequency bands have been suggested as the mechanism underlying neural binding. Recently, a considerable amount of work has focused on phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)– a form of cross-frequency coupling where the amplitude of a high frequency signal is modulated by the phase of low frequency oscillations. The existing methods for assessing PAC have some limitations including limited frequency resolution and sensitivity to noise, data length and sampling rate due to the inherent dependence on bandpass filtering. In this paper, we propose a new time-frequency based PAC (t-f PAC) measure that can address these issues. The proposed method relies on a complex time-frequency distribution, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID)-Rihaczek distribution, to estimate both the phase and the envelope of low and high frequency oscillations, respectively. As such, it does not rely on bandpass filtering and possesses some of the desirable properties of time-frequency distributions such as high frequency resolution. The proposed technique is first evaluated for simulated data and then applied to an EEG speeded reaction task dataset. The results illustrate that the proposed time-frequency based PAC is more robust to varying signal parameters and provides a more accurate measure of coupling strength.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Background: Emotions are thought to be related to distinct patterns of neural oscillations, but the interactions among multi-frequency neural oscillations during different emotional states lack full exploration. Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising tool for understanding the complexity of the neurophysiological system, thereby playing a crucial role in revealing the physiological mechanisms underlying emotional electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the non-sinusoidal characteristics of EEG lead to the non-uniform distribution of phase angles, which could potentially affect the analysis of phase-amplitude coupling. Removing phase clustering bias (PCB) can uniform the distribution of phase angles, but the effect of this approach is unknown on emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling. This study aims to explore the effect of PCB on cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling for emotional EEG. Methods: The technique of removing PCB was implemented on a publicly accessible emotional EEG dataset to calculate debiased phase-amplitude coupling. Statistical analysis and classification were conducted to compare the difference in emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling prior to and post the removal of PCB. Results: Emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling values are overestimated due to PCB. Removing PCB enhances the difference in coupling strength between fear and happy emotions in the frontal lobe. Comparable emotion recognition performance was achieved with fewer features after removing PCB. Conclusions: These findings suggest that removing PCB enhances the difference in emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling patterns and generates features that contain more emotional information. Removing PCB may be advantageous for analyzing emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling and recognizing human emotions.</jats:p>},

  author = {Dae-Cheol Gwon and M. Ahn},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Motor imagery modulates specific neural oscillations like actual movement does. Representatively, suppression of the alpha power (e.g., event-related desynchronization [ERD]) is the typical pattern of motor imagery in the motor cortex. However, in addition to this amplitude-based feature, the coupling across frequencies includes important information about the brain functions and the existence of such complex information has been reported in various invasive studies. Yet, the interaction across multiple frequencies during motor imagery processing is still unclear and has not been widely studied, particularly concerning the non-invasive signals. In this study, we provide empirical evidence of the comodulation between the phase of alpha rhythm and the amplitude of high gamma rhythm during the motor imagery process. We used electroencephalography (EEG) in our investigation during the imagination of left- or right-hand movement recorded from 52 healthy subjects, and quantified the ERD of alpha and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which is a relative change of modulation index to the base line period (before the cue). As a result, we found that the coupling between the phase of alpha (8-12 Hz) and the amplitude of high gamma (70-120 Hz) and this PAC decreases during motor imagery and then rebounds to the baseline like alpha ERD (r = 0.29 to 0.42). This correlation between PAC and ERD was particularly stronger in the ipsilateral area. In addition, trials that demonstrated higher alpha power during the ready period (before the cue) showed a larger ERD during motor imagery and similarly, trials with higher modulation index during the ready period yielded a greater decrease in PAC during imagery. In the classification analysis, we found that the effective phase frequency that showed better decoding accuracy in left and right-hand imagery, varied across subjects. Motivated by result, we proposed a weighted cross-frequency coupling (WCFC) method that extracts the maximal discriminative feature by combining band power and CFC. In the evaluation, WCFC with only two electrodes yielded a performance comparable to the conventional algorithm with 64 electrodes in classifying left and right-hand motor imagery. These results indicate that the phase-amplitude frequency plays an important role in motor imagery, and that optimizing this frequency ranges is crucial for extracting information features to decode the motor imagery types.},

Our behavioural analysis shows better performance for the dominant hand. Importantly, there was a strong effect of TMR, with improved performance on the cued sequence after sleep. Closer examination revealed a significant benefit of TMR at 10 days post-encoding, but not 24 h or 6 weeks post-encoding. Time spent in stage 2, but not stage 3, of NREM sleep predicted cueing benefit. We also found a significant increase in spindle density and SO-spindle coupling during the cue period, when compared to the no-cue period. Together, our results demonstrate that TMR effects evolve over several weeks post-cueing, as well as emphasising the importance of stage 2, spindles and the SO-spindle coupling in procedural memory consolidation.},

These examples are based on control analyses and empirical observations rather than signal-processing tools. Finally, we provide concrete advice on how to determine when measures of phase-amplitude coupling can be considered trustworthy.</jats:p>},

Although spontaneous brain activity at the resting state is crucial in preparing for cognitive performance, the functional role of resting-state TGC remains unclear. To investigate the role of resting-state TGC, electroencephalogram recordings were obtained for 56 healthy volunteers while they were in the resting state, with their eyes closed, and then when they were engaged in a retention interval period in the visual memory task. The TGCs of the two different conditions were calculated and compared. The results indicated that the modulation index of TGC during the retention interval of the visual working memory (VWM) task was not higher than that during the resting state; however, the topographical distribution of TGC during the resting state was negatively correlated with TGC during VWM task at the local level. The topographical distribution of TGC during the resting state was negatively correlated with TGC coordinates’ engagement of brain areas in local and large-scale networks and during task performance at the local level. These findings support the view that TGC reflects information-processing and signal interaction across distant brain areas. These results demonstrate that TGC could explain the efficiency of competing brain networks.</jats:p>},

Network structure and efficiency reveal different brain states along with different ways of processing the information. This work is structured around the exploratory analysis of the brain processes involved in low-level auditory processing. A complex network analysis was performed on the basis of brain coupling obtained from Electroencephalography (EEG) data, while different auditory stimuli were presented to the subjects. This coupling is inferred from the Phase-Amplitude coupling (PAC) from different EEG electrodes to explore differences between controls and dyslexic subjects. Coupling data allows the construction of a graph, and then, graph theory is used to study the characteristics of the complex networks throughout time for controls and dyslexics. This results in a set of metrics including clustering coefficient, path length and small-worldness. From this, different characteristics linked to the temporal evolution of networks and coupling are pointed out for dyslexics. Our study revealed patterns related to Dyslexia as losing the small-world topology. Finally, these graph-based features are used to classify between controls and dyslexic subjects by means of a Support Vector Machine (SVM).},

While this phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) has been demonstrated in a variety of tasks and cortical regions, it has not been shown whether task demands differentially affect the regional distribution of the preferred low-frequency coupling to high gamma. To address this issue we investigated multiple-rhythm theta/alpha to high gamma PAC in two subjects with implanted subdural electrocorticographic grids. We show that high gamma amplitude couples to the theta and alpha troughs and demonstrate that, during visual tasks, alpha/high gamma coupling preferentially increases in visual cortical regions. These results suggest that low-frequency phase to high-frequency amplitude coupling is modulated by behavioral task and may reflect a mechanism for selection between communicating neuronal networks.},

  abstract = {<jats:label>1.</jats:label><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There is increasing interest in understanding how the phase and amplitude of distinct neural oscillations might interact to support dynamic communication within the brain. In particular, previous work has demonstrated a coupling between the phase of low frequency oscillations and the amplitude (or power) of high frequency oscillations during certain tasks, termed phase amplitude coupling (PAC). For instance, during visual processing in humans, PAC has been reliably observed between ongoing alpha (8-13Hz) and gamma-band (&gt;40Hz) activity. However, the application of PAC metrics to electrophysiological data can be challenging due to numerous methodological issues and lack of coherent approaches within the field. Therefore, in this article we outline the various analysis steps involved in detecting PAC, using an openly available MEG dataset from 16 participants performing an interactive visual task. Firstly, we localised gamma and alpha-band power using the Fieldtrip toolbox, and extracted time courses from area V1, defined using a multimodal parcellation scheme. These V1 responses were analysed for changes in alpha-gamma PAC, using four common algorithms. Results showed an increase in gamma (40-100Hz) - alpha (7-13Hz) PAC in response to the visual grating stimulus, though specific patterns of coupling were somewhat dependent upon the algorithm employed. Additionally, post-hoc analyses showed that these results were not driven by the presence of non-sinusoidal oscillations, and that trial length was sufficient to obtain reliable PAC estimates. Finally, throughout the article, methodological issues and practical guidelines for ongoing PAC research will be discussed.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) measures the relationship between the phase of low-frequency oscillations (LFO) and the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations (HFO). It plays an important functional role in neural information processing and cognition. Thus, we propose a novel method based on the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence and correlation matrix. The method takes the amplitude distributions of the HFO located in the corresponding phase bins of the LFO as multichannel inputs to construct a correlation matrix, where the elements are calculated based on the JS divergence between pairs of amplitude distributions. Then, the omega complexity extracted from the correlation matrix is used to estimate the PAC strength. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reflect the PAC strength and slightly vary with the data length. Moreover, it outperforms five frequently used algorithms in the performance against additive white Gaussian noise and spike noise and the ability of detecting PAC in wide frequency ranges. To validate our proposed method with real data, it was applied to analyze the local field potential recorded from the dorsomedial striatum in a male Sprague-Dawley rat. It can replicate previous results obtained with other PAC metrics. In conclusion, these results suggest that our proposed method is a powerful tool for measuring the PAC between neural oscillations.},

Hippocampal coupling was extensive, with the majority of channels expressing spectral interactions. NREM consistently showed delta–ripple coupling, but ripples were also modulated by slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. SO–delta and SO–theta coupling, as well as interactions between delta/theta and spindle/beta frequencies also occurred. During REM, limited interactions between delta/theta and beta frequencies emerged. Moreover, oscillatory organization differed substantially between i) hippocampus and scalp, ii) sites along the anterior-posterior hippocampal axis, and iii) individuals.

  abstract = {Cross-frequency coupling is emerging as a crucial mechanism that coordinates the integration of spectrally and spatially distributed neuronal oscillations. Recently, phase-amplitude coupling, a form of cross-frequency coupling, where the phase of a slow oscillation modulates the amplitude of a fast oscillation, has gained attention. Existing phase-amplitude coupling measures are mostly confined to either coupling within a region or between pairs of brain regions. Given the availability of multi-channel electroencephalography recordings, a multivariate analysis of phase amplitude coupling is needed to accurately quantify the coupling across multiple frequencies and brain regions. In the present work, we propose a tensor based approach, i.e., higher order robust principal component analysis, to identify response-evoked phase-amplitude coupling across multiple frequency bands and brain regions. Our experiments on both simulated and electroencephalography data demonstrate that the proposed multivariate phase-amplitude coupling method can capture the spatial and spectral dynamics of phase-amplitude coupling more accurately compared to existing methods. Accordingly, we posit that the proposed higher order robust principal component analysis based approach filters out the background phase-amplitude coupling activity and predominantly captures the event-related phase-amplitude coupling dynamics to provide insight into the spatially distributed brain networks across different frequency bands.},

  abstract = {Neural oscillations are at the core of important computations in the mammalian brain. Interactions between oscillatory activities in different frequency bands, such as delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), or gamma (>30 Hz), are a powerful mechanism for binding fundamentally distinct spatiotemporal scales of neural processing. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is one such plausible and well-described interaction, but much is yet to be uncovered regarding how PAC dynamics contribute to sensory representations. In particular, although PAC appears to have a major role in audition, the characteristics of coupling profiles in sensory and integration (i.e. frontal) cortical areas remain obscure. Here, we address this question by studying PAC dynamics in the frontal-auditory field (FAF; an auditory area in the bat frontal cortex) and the auditory cortex (AC) of the bat Carollia perspicillata. By means of simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in frontal and auditory cortices examining local-field potentials (LFPs), we show that the amplitude of gamma-band activity couples with the phase of low-frequency LFPs in both structures. Our results demonstrate that the coupling in FAF occurs most prominently in delta/high-gamma frequencies (1-4/75-100 Hz), whereas in the AC the coupling is strongest in the theta/low-gamma (2-8/25-55 Hz) range. We argue that distinct PAC profiles may represent different mechanisms for neuronal processing in frontal and auditory cortices, and might complement oscillatory interactions for sensory processing in the frontal-auditory cortex network.},

A theory that has gained a lot of traction in recent years suggests that multi-scale integration is regulated by a hierarchy of mutually interacting neural oscillations. In particular, there is accumulating evidence that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a specific form of cross-frequency interaction, plays a key role in numerous cognitive processes. Current research in the field is not only hampered by the absence of a gold standard for PAC analysis, but also by the computational costs of running exhaustive computations on large and high-dimensional electrophysiological brain signals. In addition, various signal properties and analyses parameters can lead to spurious PAC. Here, we present Tensorpac, an open-source Python toolbox dedicated to PAC analysis of neurophysiological data. The advantages of Tensorpac include (1) higher computational efficiency thanks to software design that combines tensor computations and parallel computing, (2) the implementation of all most widely used PAC methods in one package, (3) the statistical analysis of PAC measures, and (4) extended PAC visualization capabilities.

  abstract = {'Phase amplitude coupling' (PAC) in oscillatory neural activity describes a phenomenon whereby the amplitude of higher frequency activity is modulated by the phase of lower frequency activity. Such coupled oscillatory activity--also referred to as 'cross-frequency coupling' or 'nested rhythms'--has been shown to occur in a number of brain regions and at behaviorally relevant time points during cognitive tasks; this suggests functional relevance, but the circuit mechanisms of PAC generation remain unclear. In this paper we present a model of a canonical circuit for generating PAC activity, showing how interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neural populations can be periodically shifted in to and out of oscillatory firing patterns by afferent drive, hence generating higher frequency oscillations phase-locked to a lower frequency, oscillating input signal. Since many brain regions contain mutually connected excitatory-inhibitory populations receiving oscillatory input, the simplicity of the mechanism generating PAC in such networks may explain the ubiquity of PAC across diverse neural systems and behaviors. Analytic treatment of this circuit as a nonlinear dynamical system demonstrates how connection strengths and inputs to the populations can be varied in order to change the extent and nature of PAC activity, importantly which phase of the lower frequency rhythm the higher frequency activity is locked to. Consequently, this model can inform attempts to associate distinct types of PAC with different network topologies and physiologies in real data.},

  abstract = {Emotion, an essential aspect in inferring human psychological states, is featured by entangled oscillators operating at multiple frequencies and montages. However, the dynamics of mutual interactions among rhythmic activities in EEGs under various emotional expressions are unclear. To this end, a novel method named variational phase-amplitude coupling is proposed to quantify the rhythmic nesting structure in EEGs under emotional processing. The proposed algorithm lies in variational mode decomposition, featured by its robustness to noise artifacts and its merit in avoiding the mode-mixing problem. This novel method reduces the risk of spurious coupling compared to that with ensemble empirical mode decomposition or iterative filter when evaluated by simulations. An atlas of cross-couplings in EEGs under eight emotional processing is established. Mainly, α activity in the anterior frontal region serves as a critical sign for neutral emotional state, whereas γ amplitude seems to be linked with both positive and negative emotional states. Moreover, for those γ-amplitude-related couplings under neutral emotional state, the frontal lobe is associated with lower phase-given frequencies while the central lobe is attached to higher ones. The γ-amplitude-related coupling in EEGs is a promising biomarker for recognizing mental states. We recommend our method as an effective tool in characterizing the entangled multifrequency rhythms in brain signals for emotion neuromodulation.},

  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) where the phase of a low-frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude of a higher frequency, is becoming an important indicator of information transmission in the brain. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain undetermined. A realistic, yet tractable computational model of the phenomenon is thus needed. Here we propose a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6). The conditional transfer entropies (cTE) from the phases to the amplitudes of the generated oscillations are estimated by means of the conditional mutual information. This approach provides information regarding directionality by distinguishing PAC from APC (amplitude-phase coupling), i.e. the information transfer from amplitudes to phases, and can be used to estimate other types of CFC such as amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC). While experiments often only focus on one or two PAC combinations (e.g., theta-gamma or alpha-gamma), we found that a cortical column can simultaneously generate almost all possible PAC combinations, depending on connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. We found that the strength of PAC between two populations was strongly correlated with the strength of the effective connections between them and, on average, did not depend upon the presence or absence of a direct (anatomical) connection. When considering a cortical column circuit as a complex network, we found that neuronal populations making indirect PAC connections had, on average, higher local clustering coefficient, efficiency, and betweenness centrality than populations making direct connections and populations not involved in PAC connections. This suggests that their interactions were more efficient when transmitting information. Since more than 60% of the obtained interactions represented indirect connections, our results highlight the importance of the topology of cortical circuits for the generation on of the PAC phenomenon. Finally, our results demonstrated that indirect PAC interactions can be explained by a cascade of direct CFC and same-frequency band interactions, suggesting that PAC analysis of experimental data should be accompanied by the estimation of other types of frequency interactions for an integrative understanding of the phenomenon.},

However, a complete understanding of the biophysical mechanisms generating this diversity is lacking.

We argue that NMMs are an appropriate mathematical framework (due to the small number of parameters and variables involved and the richness of the dynamics they can generate) to study the PAC phenomenon.</jats:p>},

The neuronal basis of this phenomenon remains unclear, though there is indication that phase modulation of neuronal oscillations—ongoing excitability fluctuations of neuronal populations in the brain—provides a mechanistic contribution. Investigating this question using naturalistic audiovisual speech with intracranial recordings in humans, we show that neuronal populations in auditory cortex track the temporal dynamics of unisensory visual speech using the phase of their slow oscillations and phase-related modulations in high-frequency activity. Auditory cortex thus builds a representation of the speech stream’s envelope based on visual speech alone, at least in part by resetting the phase of its ongoing oscillations. Phase reset could amplify the representation of the speech stream and organize the information contained in neuronal activity patterns.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</jats:title><jats:p>Watching the speaker can facilitate our understanding of what is being said.

We found that some regions of cerebral cortex that process auditory speech also respond to visual speech even when it is shown as a silent movie without a soundtrack. This response can occur through a reset of the phase of ongoing oscillations, which helps augment the response of auditory cortex to audiovisual speech.

  abstract = {Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations represents a key neurophysiological mechanism that promotes the temporal organization of oscillatory activity. For this reason, PAC has been implicated in item/context integration for episodic processes, including coordinating activity across multiple cortical regions. While data in humans has focused principally on PAC within a single brain region, data in rodents has revealed evidence that the phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation modulates gamma oscillations in the cortex (and vice versa). This pattern, termed cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), has not previously been observed in human subjects engaged in mnemonic processing. We use a unique dataset with intracranial electrodes inserted simultaneously into the hippocampus and seven cortical regions across 40 human subjects to (1) test for the presence of significant cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), (2) to establish that the magnitude of xPAC predicts memory encoding success, (3) to describe specific frequencies within the broad 2–9 Hz theta range that govern hippocampal‐cortical interactions in xPAC, and (4) compare anterior versus posterior hippocampal xPAC patterns. We find that strong functional xPAC occurs principally between the hippocampus and other mesial temporal structures, namely entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, and that xPAC is overall stronger for posterior hippocampal connections. We also show that our results are not confounded by alternative factors such as inter‐regional phase synchrony, local PAC occurring within cortical regions, or artifactual theta oscillatory waveforms.},

However, it is not known whether there is a causal relationship between these phenomena. We found that in adult male Wistar rats, silencing the medial septum during recall did not affect avoidance memory expression or maintenance but abolished hPAC and the amnesia caused by the intrahippocampal administration of reconsolidation blockers, both of which were restored by concomitant theta burst stimulation of the fimbria–fornix pathway. Remarkably, artificial hPAC generated by fimbria–fornix stimulation during recall of a learned avoidance response naturally resistant to hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation made it susceptible to reactivation-dependent amnesia. Our results indicate that hPAC mediates the destabilization required for avoidance memory reconsolidation and suggest that the generation of artificial hPAC at recall overcomes the boundary conditions of this process. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Theta-gamma hippocampal phase-amplitude coupling (hPAC) increases during the induction of hippocampus-dependent avoidance memory reconsolidation. However, whether hPAC plays a causal role in this process remains unknown. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, optogenetic, and biochemical tools in adult male Wistar rats, we demonstrate that reactivation-induced hPAC is necessary for avoidance memory destabilization, and that artificial induction of this patterned activity during recall of reconsolidation-resistant aversive memories renders them liable to the amnesic effect of reconsolidation inhibitors.},

Here, we examined PAC through electroencephalography (EEG) data collected during an awake, eyes-open EEG collection paradigm in 98 children between the ages of three months and three years. We employed non-parametric clustering methods to identify areas of significant PAC across a range of frequency pairs and electrode locations, and examined how PAC strength and phase preference develops in these areas.

Additionally, we found γ over anterior electrodes coupled with the rising phase of the α-β waveform, while γ over posterior electrodes coupled with the falling phase of the α-β waveform; this regionalized phase preference became more prominent with age.

The model suggests the conditions under which a CA1 microcircuit can operate to elicit theta-gamma PAC, and highlights the modulatory role of OLM and PVBC cells, recurrent connectivity, and short term synaptic plasticity.

Cross-frequency coupling between two different frequencies of neural oscillations is one such promising measure, believed to reflect synchronization between local and global networks in the brain. Specifically, in adults phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) has been shown to be involved in a range of cognitive processes, including working and long-term memory, attention, language, and fluid intelligence. Evidence suggests that increased PAC mediates both temporary and lasting improvements in working memory elicited by transcranial direct-current stimulation and reductions in depressive symptoms after transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, research has shown that abnormal patterns of PAC are associated with depression and schizophrenia in adults. PAC is believed to be closely related to cortico-cortico white matter (WM) microstructure, which is well established in the literature as a structural mechanism underlying mental health. Some cognitive findings have been replicated in adolescents and abnormal patterns of PAC have also been linked to ADHD in young people. However, currently most research has focused on cross-sectional adult samples. Whereas initial hypotheses suggested that PAC was a state-based measure due to an early focus on cognitive, task-based research, current evidence suggests that PAC has both state-based and stable components. Future longitudinal research focusing on PAC throughout adolescent development could further our understanding of the relationship between mental health and cognition and facilitate the development of new methods for the identification and treatment of youth mental health.</jats:p>},

Specific brain rhythms, namely theta and gamma oscillations and their synchronization, are thought of as putative mechanisms enabling EAM. Yet, the mechanisms of inter-regional interaction in the EAM network remain unclear in humans at the whole brain level. To investigate this, we analyzed EEG recordings of participants instructed to retrieve autobiographical episodes. EEG recordings were projected in the source space, and time-courses of atlas-based brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) were derived. Directed phase synchrony in high theta (7-10 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) bands and high theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were computed between each pair of ROIs. Using network-based statistics, a graph-theory method, we found statistically significant networks for each investigated mechanism. In the gamma band, two sub-networks were found, one between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and another within the medial frontal areas. In the high theta band, we found a PCC to ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) network. In phase-amplitude coupling, we found the high theta phase of the left MTL biasing the gamma amplitude of posterior regions and the vmPFC. Other regions of the temporal lobe and the insula were also phase biasing the vmPFC. These findings suggest that EAM, rather than emerging from a single mechanism at a single frequency, involves precise spatio-temporal signatures mapping on distinct memory processes. We propose that the MTL orchestrates activity in vmPFC and PCC via precise phase-amplitude coupling, with vmPFC and PCC interaction via high theta phase synchrony and gamma synchronization contributing to bind information within the PCC-MTL sub-network or valuate the candidate memory within the medial frontal sub-network.</jats:p>},

  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can identify network alterations that occur in complex psychiatric diseases and behaviors, but its interpretation is difficult because the neural basis of the infraslow BOLD fluctuations is poorly understood. Previous results link dynamic activity during the resting state to both infraslow frequencies in local field potentials (LFP) (<1 Hz) and band-limited power in higher frequency LFP (>1 Hz). To investigate the relationship between these frequencies, LFPs were recorded from rats under two anesthetics: isoflurane and dexmedetomidine. Signal phases were calculated from low-frequency LFP and compared to signal amplitudes from high-frequency LFP to determine if modulation existed between the two frequency bands (phase-amplitude coupling). Isoflurane showed significant, consistent phase-amplitude coupling at nearly all pairs of frequencies, likely due to the burst-suppression pattern of activity that it induces. However, no consistent phase-amplitude coupling was observed in rats that were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine. fMRI-LFP correlations under isoflurane using high frequency LFP were reduced when the low frequency LFP's influence was accounted for, but not vice-versa, or in any condition under dexmedetomidine. The lack of consistent phase-amplitude coupling under dexmedetomidine and lack of shared variance between high frequency and low frequency LFP as it relates to fMRI suggests that high and low frequency neural electrical signals may contribute differently, possibly even independently, to resting state fMRI. This finding suggests that researchers take care in interpreting the neural basis of resting state fMRI, as multiple dynamic factors in the underlying electrophysiology could be driving any particular observation.},

The control of dysregulated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) over the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is related to depression. However, the oscillation interaction in the mPFC-BLA circuit has remained elusive. Therefore, this study used phase–amplitude coupling (PAC), which provides complicated forms of information transmission by the phase of low-frequency rhythm, modulating the amplitude of high-frequency rhythm, and has a potential application for the treatment of neurological disease. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to prepare the rat models of depression. Moreover, multichannel <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> recording was applied to obtain the local field potentials (LFPs) of the mPFC, the BLA in rats in control, and CUMS groups, while they explored the open field. The results showed prominent coupling between the phase of theta oscillation (4–12 Hz) in the mPFC and the amplitude of high-gamma oscillation (70–120 Hz) in the BLA. Compared to the control group, this theta–gamma PAC was significantly decreased in the CUMS group, which was accompanied by the diminished exploratory behaviour. The results indicate that the coupling between the phase of theta in the mPFC and the amplitude of gamma in the BLA is involved in exploratory behaviour, and this decreased coupling may inhibit exploratory behaviour of rats exposed to CUMS.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is a well-established concept for evaluating the strength of memory coding within brain regions, and has been shown to possess the characteristic of presenting memory mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that oscillations of theta and gamma brain waves can represent the neural coding structure of memory retrieval. However, most previous studies have presented PAC-related memory mechanisms with visual modalities, and little is known about the influence of auditory stimuli. In this study, 18 participants were recruited and 36-channels electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded while they were performing an $n$ -back auditory working memory task. There were three experimental conditions with different levels of working memory load. Event-related phase-amplitude coupling (ERPAC) with the advantage of better temporal resolution was used to evaluate the coupling phenomenon from the reconstructed dipole brain sources. We primarily focused on independent components from the frontal and parietal regions, which were reported to be related to memory mechanisms. The results suggest that significant ERPAC was observed in both the frontal and parietal regions. In addition to the coupling between theta (4-7 Hz) and low gamma (30-40 Hz) frequency bands, pronounced high beta oscillations (20-30 Hz) were also observed to be modulated by the phases of theta oscillations. These findings suggest the existence of phase-amplitude coupling in the neocortex during auditory working memory, and provide a highly resolved timeline to evaluate brain dynamics. In addition, the ERPAC results also support the involvement of theta-gamma and theta-beta neural coding mechanisms in cognitive and memory tasks. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the existence of ERPAC within the frontal and parietal regions during an auditory working memory task using complex chords as stimuli, and prompt the use of complex stimuli in studies that are closer to the real-life applications of cognitive evaluations, mental treatments, and brain-computer interfaces.},

In neuroscience, this relationship provides a mechanism by which neural activity might be coordinated between distant regions. The dangers and pitfalls of assessing phase-amplitude coupling with existing statistical measures have been well-documented. The limitations of these measures include: (i) response to non-oscillatory, high-frequency, broad-band activity, (ii) response to high-frequency components of the low-frequency oscillation, (iii) adhoc selection of analysis frequency-intervals, and (iv) reliance upon data shuffling to assess statistical significance. In this work, a multitaper phase-amplitude coupling estimator is proposed that addresses issues (i)-(iv) above. Specifically, issue (i) is addressed by replacing the analytic signal envelope estimator computed using the Hilbert transform with a multitaper estimator that down-weights non-sinusoidal activity using a classical, multitaper super-resolution technique. Issue (ii) is addressed by replacing coherence between the low-frequency and high-frequency components in a standard PAC estimator with multitaper partial coherence, while issue (iii) is addressed with a physical argument regarding meaningful neural oscillation. Finally, asymptotic statistical assessment of the multitaper estimator is introduced to address issue (iv).</jats:p>},

Although there is ample evidence suggesting that neural interactions are directional, conventional PAC measures mostly quantify the cross-frequency coupling, failing to provide information on the direction of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a Granger causality (GC) based approach to estimate the direction of PAC. This approach infers the directionality of cross-frequency coupling by computing GC between the instantaneous phase and amplitude components extracted from the signal through a complex time-frequency (t-f) distribution, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID)-Rihaczek. The method is evaluated on both simulated and real electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed GC based directional PAC measure can infer the direction of neural interactions across frequency bands.},

Considering the recent valid biomarker for epilepsy surgery, we hypothesize that the approach of coupling between HFOs and low frequency phases differs SOZ from non-seizure onset zone (NSOZ). This study proposes phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) method to identify SOZ by measuring whether the amplitude of HFOs is coupled with a phase at 2-34 Hz in ECoG. Besides, three machine learning models for PAC-based features are designed for SOZ detection. Four patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) are examined to observe efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the mode of coupling is a potential feature to detect SOZ.Clinical relevance- This suggests the PAC feature between low frequency phase and HFO amplitude may be used as a candidate biomarker to detect SOZ.},

  abstract = {Modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency cortical field activity locked to changes in the phase of a slower brain rhythm is known as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). The study of this phenomenon has been gaining traction in neuroscience because of several reports on its appearance in normal and pathological brain processes in humans as well as across different mammalian species. This has led to the suggestion that PAC may be an intrinsic brain process that facilitates brain inter-area communication across different spatiotemporal scales. Several methods have been proposed to measure the PAC process, but few of these enable detailed study of its time course. It appears that no studies have reported details of PAC dynamics including its possible directional delay characteristic. Here, we study and characterize the use of a novel information theoretic measure that may address this limitation: local transfer entropy. We use both simulated and actual intracranial electroencephalographic data. In both cases, we observe initial indications that local transfer entropy can be used to detect the onset and offset of modulation process periods revealed by mutual information estimated phase-amplitude coupling (MIPAC). We review our results in the context of current theories about PAC in brain electrical activity, and discuss technical issues that must be addressed to see local transfer entropy more widely applied to PAC analysis. The current work sets the foundations for further use of local transfer entropy for estimating PAC process dynamics, and extends and complements our previous work on using local mutual information to compute PAC (MIPAC).},

Although recent evidence suggests that PAC might play a functional role during sensorimotor, and cognitive events, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain imprecise. Thus, a realistic but simple enough computational model of the phenomenon is needed. Here we propose a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6). While experimental studies often focus in only one or two PAC combinations (e.g., theta-gamma or alpha-gamma) our simulations show that the cortical column can generate almost all possible couplings of phases and amplitudes, which are influenced by connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that the effective connectivity between neuronal populations can result in the emergence of PAC combinations with frequencies different from the natural frequencies of the oscillators involved. For instance, simulations of oscillators with natural frequencies in the theta, alpha and gamma bands, were able to produce significant PAC combinations involving delta and beta bands.},

Among the various brain neuromodulation techniques, phase-dependent stimulation has a strong potential to modulate PAC levels. In this study, we utilize a computational model in the NEURON environment based on a detailed mathematical model of neuronal populations, consisting of networks with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, to simulate PAC generation.

Simulated data from the model shows that stimulation locked to the phase of slower rhythms increased PAC level during stimulation. These results demonstrate the capacity of phase-dependent stimulation to modulate PAC, which could allow for applications in the treatment of neurological disorders associated with abnormal PAC, such as Parkinson's disease.Clinical Relevance— Analyzing the origins of neuronal PAC and developing a brain stimulation technique for modulating the level of PAC can facilitate the development of novel treatment methods for neurological disorders associated with abnormal cross-frequency coupling.},

The estimation of PAC with meaningful bandwidth for the high frequency amplitude is crucial in order to avoid misinterpretations. While recommendations on the bandwidth of PAC’s amplitude component exist, there is no consensus yet. Here, we show that the earlier recommendations on filter settings lead to estimates which are smeared in the frequency domain, which makes it difficult to distinguish higher harmonics from other types of CFC. We also show that smearing can be avoided with a different choice of filter settings by theoretically relating PAC to bicoherence. To illustrate this, PAC estimates of simulations and empirical data are compared to bispectral analyses. We used simulations replicated from an earlier study and empirical data from human electro-encephalography and rat local field potentials. PAC’s amplitude component was estimated using a bandwidth with a ratio of (1) 2:1, (2) 1:1, or (3) 0.5:1 relative to the frequency of the phase component. For both simulated and empirical data, PAC was smeared over a broad frequency range and not present when the estimates comprised a 2:1- and 0.5:1-ratio, respectively. In contrast, the 1:1-ratio accurately avoids smearing and results in clear signals of CFC. Bicoherence estimates, which do not smear across frequencies by construction, were found to be essentially identical to PAC calculated with the recommended frequency setting.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Brain oscillations reflect changes in electrical potentials summated across neuronal populations. Low- and high-frequency rhythms have different modulation patterns. Slower rhythms are spatially broad, while faster rhythms are more local. From this observation, we hypothesized that low- and high-frequency oscillations reflect white- and gray-matter communications, respectively, and synchronization between low-frequency phase with high-frequency amplitude represents a mechanism enabling distributed brain-networks to coordinate local processing. Testing this common understanding, we selectively disrupted white or gray matter connections to human cortex while recording surface field potentials. Counter to our original hypotheses, we found that cortex consists of independent oscillatory-units (IOUs) that maintain their own complex endogenous rhythm structure. IOUs are differentially modulated by white and gray matter connections. White-matter connections maintain topographical anatomic heterogeneity (i.e., separable processing in cortical space) and gray-matter connections segregate cortical synchronization patterns (i.e., separable temporal processing through phase-power coupling). Modulation of distinct oscillatory modules enables the functional diversity necessary for complex processing in the human brain.},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Despite recent progress in the analysis of neuroimaging data sets, our comprehension of the main mechanisms and principles which govern human brain cognition and function remains incomplete. Network neuroscience makes substantial efforts to manipulate these challenges and provide real answers. For the last decade, researchers have been modelling brain structure and function via a graph or network that comprises brain regions that are either anatomically connected via tracts or functionally via a more extensive repertoire of functional associations. Network neuroscience is a relatively new multidisciplinary scientific avenue of the study of complex systems by pursuing novel ways to analyze, map, store and model the essential elements and their interactions in complex neurobiological systems, particularly the human brain, the most complex system in nature. Due to a rapid expansion of neuroimaging data sets' size and complexity, it is essential to propose and adopt new empirical tools to track dynamic patterns between neurons and brain areas and create comprehensive maps. In recent years, there is a rapid growth of scientific interest in moving functional neuroimaging analysis beyond simplified group or time‐averaged approaches and sophisticated algorithms that can capture the time‐varying properties of functional connectivity. We describe algorithms and network metrics that can capture the dynamic evolution of functional connectivity under this perspective. We adopt the word ‘chronnectome’ (integration of the Greek word ‘Chronos’, which means time, and connectome) to describe this specific branch of network neuroscience that explores how mutually informed brain activity correlates across time and brain space in a functional way. We also describe how good temporal mining of temporally evolved dynamic functional networks could give rise to the detection of specific brain states over which our brain evolved. This characteristic supports our complex human mind. The temporal evolution of these brain states and well‐known network metrics could give rise to new analytic trends. Functional brain networks could also increase the multi‐faced nature of the dynamic networks revealing complementary information. Finally, we describe a python module (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/makism/dyconnmap">https://github.com/makism/dyconnmap</jats:ext-link>) which accompanies this article and contains a collection of dynamic complex network analytics and measures and demonstrates its great promise for the study of a healthy subject's repeated fMRI scans.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Various hand-crafted feature representations of bio-signals rely primarily on the amplitude or power of the signal in specific frequency bands. The phase component is often discarded as it is more sample specific, and thus more sensitive to noise, than the amplitude. However, in general, the phase component also carries information relevant to the underlying biological processes. In fact, in this paper we show the benefits of learning the coupling of both phase and amplitude components of a bio-signal. We do so by introducing a novel self-supervised learning task, which we call phase-swap, that detects if bio-signals have been obtained by merging the amplitude and phase from different sources. We show in our evaluation that neural networks trained on this task generalize better across subjects and recording sessions than their fully supervised counterpart.},

  abstract = {Cross frequency coupling (CFC) between electrophysiological signals in the brain has been observed and it's abnormalities have been observed in conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. More recently, CFC has been observed in stomach-brain electrophysiologic studies and thus becomes an enticing possible target for diseases involving aberrations of the gut-brain axis. However, current methods of detecting coupling do not attempt to capture the underlying statistical relationships that give rise to this coupling. In this paper, we demonstrate a new method of calculating phase amplitude coupling by estimating the mutual information between phase and amplitude, using a flexible parametric modeling approach. Specifically, we develop an exponential generalized linear model (GLM) to model amplitude given phase, using a high dimensional basis of von-Mises function regressors and $\ell_\{1\}$ regularized model selection. Using synthetically generated gut-brain coupled signals, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing gold-standard methods for detectable low-levels of phase amplitude coupling through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.},

  year = {2016},
  abstract = {The level of activity of many animals including humans rises and falls with a period of ~ 24 hours. The intrinsic biological oscillator that gives rise to this circadian oscillation is driven by a molecular feedback loop with an approximately 24 hour cycle period and is influenced by the environment, most notably the light:dark cycle. In addition to the circadian oscillations, behavior of many animals is influenced by multiple oscillations occurring at faster—ultradian—time scales. These ultradian oscillations are also thought to be driven by feedback loops. While many studies have focused on identifying such ultradian oscillations, less is known about how the ultradian behavioral oscillations interact with each other and with the circadian oscillation. Decoding the coupling among the various physiological oscillators may be important for understanding how they conspire together to regulate the normal activity levels, as well in disease states in which such rhythmic fluctuations in behavior may be disrupted. Here, we use a wavelet-based cross-frequency analysis to show that different oscillations identified in spontaneous mouse behavior are coupled such that the amplitude of oscillations occurring at higher frequencies are modulated by the phase of the slower oscillations. The patterns of these interactions are different among different individuals. Yet this variability is not random. Differences in the pattern of interactions are confined to a low dimensional subspace where different patterns of interactions form clusters. These clusters expose the differences among individuals—males and females are preferentially segregated into different clusters. These sex-specific features of spontaneous behavior were not apparent in the spectra. Thus, our methodology reveals novel aspects of the structure of spontaneous animal behavior that are not observable using conventional methodology.},

Two primary neuronal coupling modes have been described: phase-coupling and amplitude-coupling. Theoretically, both coupling modes are independent, but so far, their neuronal relationship remains unclear. Here, we combined MEG, source-reconstruction and simulations to systematically compare cortical phase-coupling and amplitude-coupling patterns in the human brain. Importantly, we took into account a critical bias of amplitude-coupling measures due to phase-coupling. We found differences between both coupling modes across a broad frequency range and most of the cortex. Furthermore, by combining empirical measurements and simulations we ruled out that these results were caused by methodological biases, but instead reflected genuine neuronal amplitude coupling. Overall, our results suggest that cortical phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns are non-redundant, which may reflect at least partly distinct neuronal mechanisms.
