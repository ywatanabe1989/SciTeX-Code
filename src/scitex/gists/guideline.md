# Guidelines for New Programmers

## Preface
- #### Programming is all about Automation
  Automate repetitive steps; _e.g._, "A -> B -> C" to "A -> C".
- #### Programming is a skill
  Programming is not knowledge but a skill. To ride a bicycle, all you need is to ride a bicycle.

## Use English
- Read, write, and think in English.

## Keyboard
- #### Keyboard > Mouse
- #### Shortcuts are Key to Enhancing Productivity
  Shortcuts are often linked to English. You will realize a large number of software have common shortcuts.
- #### Stick to ONE Keyboard
  Preferably [the HHKB Keyboard](https://www.pfuemea.com/en-gb/dr_product/hhkb-professional-hybrid-type-s-charcoal-45g-tkl-blank-keycaps-pd-kb800bns). Your keyboard is the interface between you and computers, like an extension of your body.
- #### Maintain Home Position
  "Ctrl + n" is better than "Enter".
- #### Use the Entire Hand
  Utilize the root of your left hand for keys like "Alt".


## Emacs —more than an editor—
- #### Install [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
  - Open Emacs. Try ‘M-x help-with-tutorial RET’ (hold down Alt (Meta) key while hitting ‘x’, then type ‘help-with-tutorial’, then hit Enter). 
- #### Create shortcuts
  Define shortcut keys by writing Elisp code. Regularly update the configuration files.

## Coding
- #### Interact with computers
  Observe inputs and outputs. Error code is your friend.
- #### Googlability
  If you have any comments or queries, feel free to visit [Google.com](https://www.google.com/) or press "Ctrl + K" on your browser. Finding suitable information on the Internet is a critical skill.
- #### ChatGPT
  Incorporate ChatGPT for your editor.

- #### Avoid Comments
  Code itself should be descriptive. Comments should help readers to understand "why" instead of "what".
