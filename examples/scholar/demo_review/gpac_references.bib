This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate whether antiseizure medication (ASM)-induced changes in the Modulation Index (MI), a measure of phase-amplitude coupling, could serve as a biomarker for determining the predominant laterality of drug resistance in BTLE. A 35-year-old patient with drug-resistant BTLE underwent stereoelectroencephalog...}
