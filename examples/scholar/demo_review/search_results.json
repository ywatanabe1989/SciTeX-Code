    "abstract": "Selecting the optimal resection side in bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (BTLE) remains a challenge due to independent seizure origins in both temporal lobes. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate whether antiseizure medication (ASM)-induced changes in the Modulation Index (MI), a measure of phase-amplitude coupling, could serve as a biomarker for determining the predominant laterality of drug resistance in BTLE. A 35-year-old patient with drug-resistant BTLE underwent stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) targeting bilateral temporal structures. To assess refractory epileptic focus, MI values were compared between the ASM-withdrawn and ASM-resumed states. The MI was calculated between high-frequency oscillations and 3-4 Hz slow-wave activity during interictal epochs. Following ASM resumption, MI values significantly decreased in the right hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, while the left entorhinal cortex showed persistently elevated MI without significant reduction. These findings indicated a more refractory epileptic focus in the left temporal lobe. A left temporal lobectomy was performed, leading to seizure freedom for 37 months (International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Class 1), without changes in the ASM regimen. ASM-induced MI changes in interictal SEEG may offer insights into lateralizing the more refractory temporal lobe in patients with BTLE and could potentially support resection side selection. However, further studies in larger cohorts are warranted to confirm its clinical utility and to establish standardized MI thresholds.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS), but also the sole implantation of the electrodes and dopaminergic medication, can reduce symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Furthermore, an effect on network activity is known for all three options separately. However, long-term effects have rarely been investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we focus on the long-term impact of dopaminergic medication on whole-brain network activity following DBS electrode implantation. Therefore, we extracted resting state networks (RSNs) of 20 PD patients (4 females, (59.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.72\u00a0years) from magnetoencephalography data. We recorded 30\u00a0min of resting-state activity two days before and one year after implantation of the electrodes with and without dopaminergic medication, but DBS was turned off. RSNs were obtained based on the phase-amplitude coupling between a low-frequency phase and a high gamma amplitude and examined for differences between conditions (i.e., pre- vs. post-surgery). We identified three RSNs across all conditions: sensory-motor, visual, and frontal. Each RSN was selectively altered due to a year of disease progression - while patients being treated with dopaminergic medication and DBS. In line with previous literature, we focus on longitudinal changes in RSNs over time after electrode implantation, acknowledging that chronic DBS treatment and other factors may confound the interpretation of these changes. In addition, the alterations found were RSN specific, as dopaminergic medication showed a greater impact on the frontal RSN, and the longitudinal factor expressed by the disease progression was more severe in alterations in the SMN and the visual RSN.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal formation (HF) plays a key role in avian spatial navigation. Previous studies suggest that the HF may serve different functions at various stages in pigeons' long-distance outdoor homing flight. However, it remains unclear whether the HF exhibits specific neural responses during these stages. In this study, we employed a wearable bimodal data recording system to simultaneously capture flight trajectories and hippocampal local field potential (LFP) signals of pigeons (either sex) during outdoor homing navigation. Our results revealed significant differences in hippocampal neural responses across the initial decision-making (DM) and en route navigation (ER) stages. Specifically, elevated LFP power in theta (4-12 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) bands was detected during the DM stage compared to the ER stage, while the high gamma (60-120 Hz) band exhibited the opposite pattern. In addition, we examined typical theta-beta phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) during the ER stage. Additionally, stage-specific hippocampal responses remained consistent across release sites. Notably, the difference in hippocampal responses across stages diminished along with the accumulation of homing experience. These results offer new insights into the role of the avian HF in homing flight navigation and suggest parallels between avian and mammalian hippocampal mechanisms in spatial learning.",

This review explores the latest neuromodulation techniques, focusing on the critical role of \u03b3 oscillations in various brain disorders. Direct \u03b3 neuromodulation induces \u03b3-frequency oscillations to synchronize disrupted brain networks, while indirect methods influence \u03b3 oscillations by modulating cortical excitability. We investigate how monitoring dynamic features of \u03b3 oscillations allows for detailed evaluations of neuromodulation effectiveness. By targeting \u03b3 oscillatory patterns and restoring healthy cross-frequency coupling, interventions may alleviate cognitive and behavioral symptoms linked to disrupted communication. This review examines clinical applications of \u03b3 neuromodulations, including enhancing cognitive function through 40 Hz multisensory stimulation in Alzheimer's disease, improving motor function in Parkinson's disease, controlling seizures in epilepsy, and modulating emotional dysfunctions in depression. Additionally, these neuromodulation strategies aim to regulate excitatory-inhibitory imbalances and restore \u03b3 synchrony across neurological and psychiatric disorders. The review highlights the potential of \u03b3 oscillations as biomarkers to boost restorative results in clinical applications of neuromodulation. Future studies might focus on integrating multimodal personalized protocols, artificial intelligence (AI) driven frameworks for neural decoding, and global multicenter collaborations to standardize and scale precision treatments across diverse disorders.",

We addressed this question by simultaneously recording neural activity from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and medial frontal cortex (MFC) during a goal-directed visual search task. We found that gamma-band synchronization between the MTL and MFC signaled target detection. Using two additional tasks, we dissociated the neural processes underlying working memory and search decision execution, revealing distinct patterns of synchronization. Further analyses showed that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) spike-MTL LFP synchronization encoded search dynamics and contributed to guiding behavior. Importantly, MTL-MFC synchronization disproportionately modulated neural representational geometry, highlighting its impact on information encoding. Finally, we demonstrated directional gamma influences across brain areas and cross-frequency coupling. Together, these findings illuminate the circuit-level dynamics underlying visual attention and offer insights into how the human brain selectively processes information in complex visual environments.",

Researchers have proposed mechanisms for mindfulness' comprehensive effects, such as through mental flexibility, and examined indices of neurophysiological changes. This study provided a new neuroscientific index via the aid of a neurofeedback device to investigate the role of active cortical control and, hence, mental flexibility in Buddhist meditation practitioners as compared to nonpractitioners. Twenty-eight Buddhist meditation practitioners and 28 nonpractitioners proceeded individually with the EEG neurofeedback procedure as well as with the assessments of self-esteem, subjective well-being, and Buddhist mindfulness levels. The neurofeedback procedure was designed to provide signal feedback according to participants' alpha brainwaves state, and participants were asked to maintain the appearance and disappearance of the signal as best as they could. The alpha transformation index was computed to measure the ability to voluntarily transition between their mental states. Our results showed that after controlling for age and gender, practitioners demonstrated a significantly higher alpha transformation index, indicating greater mental flexibility, along with enhanced self-esteem, life satisfaction, and lower negative affect as compared to nonpractitioners. The alpha transformation index was also significantly and positively correlated with Buddhist mindfulness levels and life satisfaction. These findings suggest that mindfulness might help improve the ability to switch between different mental processes via modulations of neural efficiency markers and exert its beneficial effects. The newly developed neuroscientific index also encourages future worthwhile investigations.",

    "abstract": "Offset analgesia reflects time-dependent, central nervous system pain inhibition and refers to a dramatic drop in pain intensity after an offset of noxious stimulus intensity. Neuropathic and nociplastic pain conditions with strong central nervous system pathophysiologic mechanisms show deficits in offset analgesia. Whether offset analgesia is altered in more peripherally driven chronic nociceptive pain was unknown. Therefore, the primary goal of the current study was to determine whether chronic nociceptive pain is associated with changes in offset analgesia. We measured offset analgesia and sensory function using quantitative sensory tests, patient-reported pain and function, and walking and stair climbing performance using standardized tasks in knee osteoarthritis patients with equivalent joint degeneration but Moderate-to-Severe (n = 36) or Mild pain intensity (n = 36) and Pain-free controls without knee osteoarthritis (n = 30) matching for age, gender, and body mass index. Offset analgesia was significantly reduced in knee osteoarthritis groups compared with the Pain-free controls, with deficits occurring at both the nonpainful forearm and painful knee and in both genders. Greater deficits in offset analgesia were associated with more impairment in walking and stair climbing. Onset hyperalgesia, a novel measure of time-dependent pain facilitation, was reduced in women with Mild knee pain but not in men. These results suggest that deficits in temporal pain inhibition and gender-specific changes in temporal pain facilitation may contribute to pain and functional impairment in knee osteoarthritis, supporting further study of central pain modulation as a clinically relevant mechanism of chronic nociceptive pain.",

    "abstract": "Object pose estimation is essential for computer vision applications such as quality inspection, robotic bin picking, and warehouse logistics. However, this task often requires expensive equipment such as 3D cameras or Lidar sensors, as well as significant computational resources. Many state-of-the-art methods for 6D pose estimation depend on deep neural networks, which are computationally demanding and require GPUs for real-time performance. Moreover, they usually involve the collection and labeling of large training datasets, which is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a template-based matching algorithm that utilizes a novel perceptual hashing method for binary images, enabling fast and robust pose estimation. This approach allows the automatic preselection of a subset of templates, significantly reducing inference time while maintaining similar accuracy. Our solution runs efficiently on multiple devices without GPU support, offering reduced runtime and high accuracy on cost-effective hardware. We benchmarked our proposed approach on a body-in-white automotive part and a widely used publicly available dataset. Our set of experiments on a synthetically generated dataset reveals a trade-off between accuracy and computation time superior to a previous work on the same automotive-production use case. Additionally, our algorithm efficiently utilizes all CPU cores and includes adjustable parameters for balancing computation time and accuracy, making it suitable for a wide range of applications where hardware cost and power efficiency are critical. For instance, with a rotation step of 10\u00b0 in the template database, we achieve an average rotation error of ",

The reconstruction algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, the vector of SPI measurements is multiplied by the generalized inverse of the measurement matrix. In the second stage, we compare two reconstruction approaches: one based on an iterative algorithm and the other on a trained neural network. The neural network outperforms the iterative method when the object resembles the training set, though it lacks the generality of the iterative approach. For images captured at a compression of 0.41 percent, corresponding to a measurement rate of 6.8 Hz with a DMD operating at 22 kHz, the typical reconstruction time on a desktop with a medium-performance GPU is comparable to the image acquisition rate. This allows the proposed SPI method to support high-resolution dynamic SPI in a variety of applications, using a standard SPI architecture with a DMD modulator operating at its native resolution and bandwidth, and enabling the real-time processing of the measured data with no additional delay on a standard desktop PC.",

EEG results indicated that SNRIs treatment significantly reduced the late positive potential (LPP) amplitude in response to negative stimuli, with parallel reductions in alpha and beta band power. Furthermore, correlations were noted between LPP changes and alterations in depressive symptoms and emotional regulation behaviors. In conclusion, SNRIs modulate brain neurophysiological activities related to emotional processing, thereby enhancing negative emotion regulation and alleviating depressive symptoms. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms behind SNRIs treatment efficacy in depression, offering a foundation for refining future treatment approaches. Notably, this study has limitations including its modest sample size and uncontrolled design, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Future larger-scale, controlled studies are warranted to confirm these preliminary observations.",

    "abstract": "The ability to construct hierarchical structures through syntactic Merge and semantic processes is a cornerstone of human language. Despite decades of debate over serial vs. parallel interaction processing models, the temporal dynamics underlying the interaction between syntax and semantics during even minimal hierarchical structure construction remain unclear. To address this, we employed a 2 (Sequence rules: hierarchical vs. linear)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 (Semantics: associated vs. unassociated) design in verb-noun sequences to disentangle syntax and semantics processing. We recorded the EEG data while 48 Chinese speakers read two words successively under a one-word probe task. The results from ERP and multivariate pattern classification analysis demonstrated (1) early syntactic Merge processing, and (2) the progressively intensifying interplay between syntax and semantics, where syntactic processing establishes structure stably from the early-stage while semantic processing incrementally intensifies over time. These findings challenge traditional serial and parallel processing models by uncovering simultaneous yet distinct temporal trajectory of syntactic and semantic processing. By bridging principles of the Minimalist Program with empirical evidence, we propose a dynamic parallel interaction processing model, highlighting the distinct but interdependent roles of syntax and semantics, with syntax serving as a foundational scaffold and semantics contributing the depth and variability needed for meaningful communication.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the spin orientation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, resulting in the discovery of various phases of matter. However, in most cases, spin orientation can be established only at specific directions of out-of-plane and in-plane, which is a drawback compared with three-dimensional systems, limiting exploration of novel physics. Here, we introduce a methodology for manipulating spin slanting in 2D multiferroic materials through ultrafast pulses of light. Based on model analysis, we find that simultaneous triggering of spin-orbit coupling-induced interactions from in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals can generate spin slanting. By choosing 2D multiferroic materials with specific low-energy composition endowed by symmetry, such triggering can be readily achieved through ultrafast light illumination, leading to light-induced spin slanting. Using real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we demonstrate this approach in multiferroic single-layer CuCr",
