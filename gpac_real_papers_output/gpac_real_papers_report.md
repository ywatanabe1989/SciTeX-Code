**Abstract**: Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity from interference1,2. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent activity are coordinated by theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling (TG-PAC). We r...

**Citations**: 23

**Abstract**: Abstract Freezing of gait is a debilitating symptom in advanced Parkinson’s disease and responds heterogeneously to treatments such as deep brain stimulation. Recent studies indicated that cortical dysfunction is involved in the development of freezing, while evidence depicting the specific role of the primary motor cortex in the multi-circuit pathology of freezing is lacking. Since abnormal beta-...

**Abstract**: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by the accumulation of toxic proteins, amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau, which eventually leads to dementia. Disease-modifying therapies are still lacking, due to incomplete insights into the neuropathological mechanisms of AD. Synaptic dysfunction is known to occur before cognitive symptoms become apparent and recent studies have dem...

**Citations**: 17

**Abstract**: The coordination between the theta phase (3–7 Hz) and gamma power (25–35 Hz) oscillations (namely theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling, PAC) in the auditory cortex has been proposed as an essential neural mechanism involved in speech processing. However, it has not been established how this mechanism is related to the efficiency with which a listener processes speech. Speech processing in a non‐na...

**Abstract**: Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is proposed to play an essential role in coordinating the processing of information on local and global scales. In recent years, the methods able to reveal trustworthy PAC has gained considerable interest. However, the intrinsic features of some signals can lead to the identification of spurious or waveform-dependent coupling. This prompted us to develop an easily ac...

**Year**: 2023 | **Venue**: Human Brain Mapping

**Citations**: 15

**Abstract**: Despite burgeoning evidence for cortical hyperarousal in insomnia disorder, the existing results on electroencephalography spectral features are highly heterogeneous. Phase‐amplitude coupling, which refers to the modulation of the low‐frequency phase to a high‐frequency amplitude, is probably a more sensitive quantitative measure for characterizing abnormal neural oscillations and explaining the t...

**Abstract**: Changes in the frequency composition of the human electroencephalogram are associated with the transitions to epileptic seizures. Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is a measure of neural oscillations in different frequency bands and brain areas, and specifically phase–amplitude coupling (PAC), a form of CFC, can be used to characterize these dynamic transitions. In this study, we propose a method for...

**Year**: 2022 | **Venue**: Journal of Neural Engineering

**Citations**: 12

**Abstract**: Objective. Diagnosing epilepsy still requires visual interpretation of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) by specialists, which prevents quantification and standardization of diagnosis. Previous studies proposed automated diagnosis by combining various features from EEG and MEG, such as relative power (Power) and functional connectivity (FC). However, the usefulness of i...

**Authors**: O. Weiner, J. O’Byrne, N. Cross, J. Giraud, Lukia Tarelli, et al.

**Year**: 2023 | **Venue**: European Journal of Neuroscience

**Citations**: 12

**Abstract**: Cross‐frequency coupling (CFC) between brain oscillations during non‐rapid‐eye‐movement (NREM) sleep (e.g. slow oscillations [SO] and spindles) may be a neural mechanism of overnight memory consolidation. Declines in CFC across the lifespan might accompany coinciding memory problems with ageing. However, there are few reports of CFC changes during sleep after learning in older adults, controlling ...

**Year**: 2024 | **Venue**: Life

**Citations**: 11

**Abstract**: Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) describes the interaction of two separate frequencies in which the lower frequency phase acts as a carrier frequency of the higher frequency amplitude. It is a means of carrying integrated streams of information between micro- and macroscale systems in the brain, allowing for coordinated activity of separate brain regions. A beta–gamma PAC increase over the sensorimo...
