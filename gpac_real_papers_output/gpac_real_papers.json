      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is the active retention and processing of information over a few seconds and is considered an essential component of cognitive function. The reduced WM capacity is a common feature in many diseases, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The theta-gamma neural code is an essential component of memory representations in the multi-item WM. A large body of studies have examined the association between cross-frequency coupling (CFC) across the cerebral cortices and WM performance; electrophysiological data together with the behavioral results showed the associations between CFC and WM performance. The oscillatory entrainment (sensory, non-invasive electrical/magnetic, and invasive electrical) remains the key method to investigate the causal relationship between CFC and WM. The frequency-tuned non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising way to improve WM performance in healthy and non-healthy patients with cognitive impairment. The WM performance is sensitive to the phase and rhythm of externally applied stimulations. CFC-transcranial-alternating current stimulation (CFC-tACS) is a recent approach in neuroscience that could alter cognitive outcomes. The studies that investigated (1) the association between CFC and WM and (2) the brain stimulation protocols that enhanced WM through modulating CFC by the means of the non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have been included in this review. In principle, this review can guide the researchers to identify the most prominent form of CFC associated with WM processing (e.g., theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling), and to define the previously published studies that manipulate endogenous CFC externally to improve WM. This in turn will pave the path for future studies aimed at investigating the CFC-tACS effect on WM. The CFC-tACS protocols need to be thoroughly studied before they can be considered as therapeutic tools in patients with WM deficits."

      "abstract": "Adult studies have shown that a basic property of resting-state (RS) brain activity is the coupling of posterior alpha oscillations (alpha phase) to posterior gamma oscillations (gamma amplitude). The present study examined whether this basic RS process is present in children. Given reports of abnormal parietal-occipital RS alpha in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the present study examined whether RS alpha-to-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is disrupted in ASD. Simulations presented in this study showed limitations with traditional PAC analyses. In particular, to avoid false-positive PAC findings, simulations showed the need to use a unilateral passband to filter the upper frequency band as well as the need for longer epochs of data. For the human study, eyes-closed RS magnetoencephalography data were analyzed from 25 children with ASD and 18 typically developing (TD) children with at least 60\u2009sec of artifact-free data. Source modeling provided continuous time course data at a midline parietal-occipital source for PAC analyses. Greater alpha-to-gamma PAC was observed in ASD than TD (p<0.005). Although children with ASD had higher PAC values, in both groups gamma activity increased at the peak of the alpha oscillation. In addition, an association between alpha power and alpha-to-gamma PAC was observed in both groups, although this relationship was stronger in ASD than TD (p<0.05). Present results demonstrated that although alpha-to-gamma PAC is present in children, this basic RS process is abnormal in children with ASD. Finally, simulations and the human data highlighted the need to consider the interplay between alpha power, epoch length, and choice of signal processing methods on PAC estimates."

      "abstract": "Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) reflects (nonlinear) interactions between signals of different frequencies. Evidence from both patient and healthy participant studies suggests that CFC plays an essential role in neuronal computation, interregional interaction, and disease pathophysiology. The present review discusses methodological advances and challenges in the computation of CFC with particular emphasis on potential solutions to spurious coupling, inferring intrinsic rhythms in a targeted frequency band, and causal interferences. We specifically focus on the literature exploring CFC in the context of cognition/memory tasks, sleep, and neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we highlight the implication of CFC in the context and for the optimization of invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation and rehabilitation. Mainly, CFC could support advancing the understanding of the neurophysiology of cognition and motor control, serve as a biomarker for disease symptoms, and leverage the optimization of therapeutic interventions, e.g., closed-loop brain stimulation. Despite the evident advantages of CFC as an investigative and translational tool in neuroscience, further methodological improvements are required to facilitate practical and correct use in cyborg and bionic systems in the field."

      "abstract": "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity from interference1,2. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory. In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality. We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity representations of working memory content that were associated with improved behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory1,2, with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related areas3\u20135. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes."

      "abstract": "Abstract Freezing of gait is a debilitating symptom in advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease and responds heterogeneously to treatments such as deep brain stimulation. Recent studies indicated that cortical dysfunction is involved in the development of freezing, while evidence depicting the specific role of the primary motor cortex in the multi-circuit pathology of freezing is lacking. Since abnormal beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling recorded from the primary motor cortex in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease indicates parkinsonian state and responses to therapeutic deep brain stimulation, we hypothesized this metric might reveal unique information on understanding and improving therapy for freezing of gait. Here, we directly recorded potentials in the primary motor cortex using subdural electrocorticography and synchronously captured gait freezing using optoelectronic motion-tracking systems in 16 freely-walking patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease who received subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation surgery. Overall, we recorded 451 timed up-and-go walking trials and quantified 7073\u2005s of stable walking and 3384\u2005s of gait freezing in conditions of on/off-stimulation and with/without dual-tasking. We found that (i) high beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the primary motor cortex was detected in freezing trials (i.e. walking trials that contained freezing), but not non-freezing trials, and the high coupling in freezing trials was not caused by dual-tasking or the lack of movement; (ii) non-freezing episodes within freezing trials also demonstrated abnormally high couplings, which predicted freezing severity; (iii) deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus reduced these abnormal couplings and simultaneously improved freezing; and (iv) in trials that were at similar coupling levels, stimulation trials still demonstrated lower freezing severity than no-stimulation trials. These findings suggest that elevated phase-amplitude coupling in the primary motor cortex indicates higher probabilities of freezing. Therapeutic deep brain stimulation alleviates freezing by both decoupling cortical oscillations and enhancing cortical resistance to abnormal coupling. We formalized these findings to a novel \u2018bandwidth model,\u2019 which specifies the role of cortical dysfunction, cognitive burden and therapeutic stimulation on the emergence of freezing. By targeting key elements in the model, we may develop next-generation deep brain stimulation approaches for freezing of gait."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by the accumulation of toxic proteins, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau, which eventually leads to dementia. Disease-modifying therapies are still lacking, due to incomplete insights into the neuropathological mechanisms of AD. Synaptic dysfunction is known to occur before cognitive symptoms become apparent and recent studies have demonstrated that imbalanced synaptic signaling drives the progression of AD, suggesting that early synaptic dysfunction could be an interesting therapeutic target. Synaptic dysfunction results in altered oscillatory activity, which can be detected with electroencephalography and electrophysiological recordings. However, the majority of these studies have been performed at advanced stages of AD, when extensive damage and cognitive symptoms are already present. The current study aimed to investigate if the hippocampal oscillatory activity is altered at pre-plaque stages of AD. The rats received stereotactic surgery to implant a laminar electrode in the CA1 layer of the right hippocampus. Electrophysiological recordings during two consecutive days in an open field were performed in 4\u20135-month-old TgF344-AD rats when increased concentrations of soluble A\u03b2 species were observed in the brain, in the absence of A\u03b2-plaques. We observed a decreased power of high theta oscillations in TgF344-AD rats compared to wild-type littermates. Sharp wave-ripple (SWR) analysis revealed an increased SWR power and a decreased duration of SWR during quiet wake in TgF344-AD rats. The alterations in properties of SWR and the increased power of fast oscillations are suggestive of neuronal hyperexcitability, as has been demonstrated to occur during presymptomatic stages of AD. In addition, decreased strength of theta-gamma coupling, an important neuronal correlate of memory encoding, was observed in the TgF344-AD rats. Theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling has been associated with memory encoding and the execution of cognitive functions. Studies have demonstrated that mild cognitive impairment patients display decreased coupling strength, similar to what is described here. The current study demonstrates altered hippocampal network activity occurring at pre-plaque stages of AD and provides insights into prodromal network dysfunction in AD. The alterations observed could aid in the detection of AD during presymptomatic stages."

      "abstract": "The coordination between the theta phase (3\u20137\u2009Hz) and gamma power (25\u201335\u2009Hz) oscillations (namely theta\u2010gamma phase\u2010amplitude coupling, PAC) in the auditory cortex has been proposed as an essential neural mechanism involved in speech processing. However, it has not been established how this mechanism is related to the efficiency with which a listener processes speech. Speech processing in a non\u2010native language offers a useful opportunity to evaluate if theta\u2010gamma PAC is modulated by the challenges imposed by the reception of speech input in a non\u2010native language. The present study investigates how auditory theta\u2010gamma PAC (recorded with magnetoencephalography) is modulated in both native and non\u2010native speech reception. Participants were Spanish native (L1) speakers studying Basque (L2) at three different levels: beginner (Grade 1), intermediate (Grade 2), and advanced (Grade 3). We found that during L2 speech processing (i) theta\u2010gamma PAC was more highly coordinated for intelligible compared to unintelligible speech; (ii) this coupling was modulated by proficiency in Basque being lower for beginners, higher for intermediate, and highest for advanced speakers (no difference observed in Spanish); (iii) gamma power did not differ between languages and groups. These findings highlight how the coordinated theta\u2010gamma oscillatory activity is tightly related to speech comprehension: the stronger this coordination is, the more the comprehension system will proficiently parse the incoming speech input."

      "abstract": "Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is proposed to play an essential role in coordinating the processing of information on local and global scales. In recent years, the methods able to reveal trustworthy PAC has gained considerable interest. However, the intrinsic features of some signals can lead to the identification of spurious or waveform-dependent coupling. This prompted us to develop an easily accessible tool that could be used to differentiate spurious from authentic PAC. Here, we propose a new tool for more reliable detection of PAC named the Extended Modulation Index ( eMI ) based on the classical Modulation Index measure of coupling. eMI is suitable both for continuous and epoched data and allows estimation of the statistical significance of each pair of frequencies for phase and for amplitude in the whole comodulogram in the framework of extreme value statistics. We compared eMI with the reference PAC measures\u2014direct PAC estimator (a modification of Mean Vector Length) and standard Modulation Index. All three methods were tested using computer-simulated data and actual local field potential recordings from freely moving rats. All methods exhibited similar properties in terms of sensitivity and specificity of PAC detection. eMI proved to be more selective in the dimension of frequency for phase. One of the novelty\u2019s offered by eMI is a heuristic algorithm for classification of PAC as Reliable or Ambiguous . It relies on analysis of the relation between the spectral properties of the signal and the detected coupling. Moreover, eMI generates visualizations that support further evaluation of the coupling properties. It also introduces the concept of the polar phase-histogram to study phase relations of coupled slow and fast oscillations. We discuss the extent to which eMI addresses the known problems of interpreting PAC. The Matlab \u00ae toolbox implementing eMI framework, and the two reference PAC estimators is freely available as EEGLAB plugin at https://github.com/GabrielaJurkiewicz/ePAC ."

      "abstract": "Emotion, an essential aspect in inferring human psychological states, is featured by entangled oscillators operating at multiple frequencies and montages. However, the dynamics of mutual interactions among rhythmic activities in EEGs under various emotional expressions are unclear. To this end, a novel method named variational phase-amplitude coupling is proposed to quantify the rhythmic nesting structure in EEGs under emotional processing. The proposed algorithm lies in variational mode decomposition, featured by its robustness to noise artifacts and its merit in avoiding the mode-mixing problem. This novel method reduces the risk of spurious coupling compared to that with ensemble empirical mode decomposition or iterative filter when evaluated by simulations. An atlas of cross-couplings in EEGs under eight emotional processing is established. Mainly, \u03b1 activity in the anterior frontal region serves as a critical sign for neutral emotional state, whereas \u03b3 amplitude seems to be linked with both positive and negative emotional states. Moreover, for those \u03b3-amplitude-related couplings under neutral emotional state, the frontal lobe is associated with lower phase-given frequencies while the central lobe is attached to higher ones. The \u03b3-amplitude-related coupling in EEGs is a promising biomarker for recognizing mental states. We recommend our method as an effective tool in characterizing the entangled multifrequency rhythms in brain signals for emotion neuromodulation."

Phase\u2010amplitude coupling, which refers to the modulation of the low\u2010frequency phase to a high\u2010frequency amplitude, is probably a more sensitive quantitative measure for characterizing abnormal neural oscillations and explaining the therapeutic effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of patients with insomnia disorder. Sixty insomnia disorder patients were randomly divided into the active and sham treatment groups to receive 4\u2009weeks of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment. Behavioral assessments, resting\u2010state electroencephalography recordings, and sleep polysomnography recordings were performed before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment. Forty good sleeper controls underwent the same assessment. We demonstrated that phase\u2010amplitude coupling values in the frontal and temporal lobes were weaker in Insomnia disorder patients than in those with good sleeper controls at baseline and that phase\u2010amplitude coupling values near the intervention area were significantly enhanced after active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment. Furthermore, the enhancement of phase\u2010amplitude coupling values was significantly correlated with the improvement of sleep quality. This study revealed the potential of phase\u2010amplitude coupling in assessing the severity of insomnia disorder and the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment, providing new insights on the abnormal physiological mechanisms and future treatments for insomnia disorder."

      "abstract": "Changes in the frequency composition of the human electroencephalogram are associated with the transitions to epileptic seizures. Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is a measure of neural oscillations in different frequency bands and brain areas, and specifically phase\u2013amplitude coupling (PAC), a form of CFC, can be used to characterize these dynamic transitions. In this study, we propose a method for seizure detection and prediction based on frequency domain analysis and PAC combined with machine learning. We analyzed two databases, the Siena Scalp EEG database and the CHB-MIT database, and used the frequency features and modulation index (MI) for time-dependent quantification. The extracted features were fed to a random forest classifier for classification and prediction. The seizure prediction horizon (SPH) was also analyzed based on the highest-performing band to maximize the time for intervention and treatment while ensuring the accuracy of the prediction. Under comprehensive consideration, the results demonstrate that better performance could be achieved at an interval length of 5 min with an average accuracy of 85.71% and 95.87% for the Siena Scalp EEG database and the CHB-MIT database, respectively. As for the adult database, the combination of PAC analysis and classification can be of significant help for seizure detection and prediction. It suggests that the rarely used SPH also has a major impact on seizure detection and prediction and further explorations for the application of PAC are needed."

      "abstract": "Objective. Diagnosing epilepsy still requires visual interpretation of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) by specialists, which prevents quantification and standardization of diagnosis. Previous studies proposed automated diagnosis by combining various features from EEG and MEG, such as relative power (Power) and functional connectivity (FC). However, the usefulness of interictal phase\u2013amplitude coupling (PAC) in diagnosing epilepsy is still unknown. We hypothesized that resting-state PAC would be different for patients with epilepsy in the interictal state and for healthy participants such that it would improve discrimination between the groups. Approach. We obtained resting-state MEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 90 patients with epilepsy during their preoperative evaluation and in 90 healthy participants. We used the cortical currents estimated from MEG and MRI to calculate Power in the \u03b4 (1\u20133 Hz), \u03b8 (4\u20137 Hz), \u03b1 (8\u201313 Hz), \u03b2 (13\u201330 Hz), low \u03b3 (35\u201355 Hz), and high \u03b3 (65\u201390 Hz) bands and FC in the \u03b8 band. PAC was evaluated using the synchronization index (SI) for eight frequency band pairs: the phases of \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, and \u03b2 and the amplitudes of low and high \u03b3. First, we compared the mean SI values for the patients with epilepsy and the healthy participants. Then, using features such as PAC, Power, FC, and features extracted by deep learning (DL) individually or combined, we tested whether PAC improves discrimination accuracy for the two groups. Main results. The mean SI values were significantly different for the patients with epilepsy and the healthy participants. The SI value difference was highest for \u03b8/low \u03b3 in the temporal lobe. Discrimination accuracy was the highest, at 90%, using the combination of PAC and DL. Significance. Abnormal PAC characterized the patients with epilepsy in the interictal state compared with the healthy participants, potentially improving the discrimination of epilepsy."

Declines in CFC across the lifespan might accompany coinciding memory problems with ageing. However, there are few reports of CFC changes during sleep after learning in older adults, controlling for baseline effects. Our objective was to examine NREM CFC in healthy older adults, with an emphasis on spindle activity and SOs from frontal electroencephalogram (EEG), during a learning night after a declarative learning task, as compared to a baseline night without learning. Twenty\u2010five older adults (M [SD] age\u2009=\u200969.12 [5.53] years; 64% female) completed a two\u2010night study, with a pre\u2010 and post\u2010sleep word\u2010pair associates task completed on the second night. SO\u2010spindle coupling strength and a measure of coupling phase distance from the SO up\u2010state were both examined for between\u2010night differences and associations with memory consolidation. Coupling strength and phase distance from the up\u2010state peak were both stable between nights. Change in coupling strength between nights was not associated with memory consolidation, but a shift in coupling phase towards (vs. away from) the up\u2010state peak after learning predicted better memory consolidation. Also, an exploratory interaction model suggested that associations between coupling phase closer to the up\u2010state peak and memory consolidation may be moderated by higher (vs. lower) coupling strength. This study supports a role for NREM CFC in sleep\u2010related memory consolidation in older adults."

      "abstract": "Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) describes the interaction of two separate frequencies in which the lower frequency phase acts as a carrier frequency of the higher frequency amplitude. It is a means of carrying integrated streams of information between micro- and macroscale systems in the brain, allowing for coordinated activity of separate brain regions. A beta\u2013gamma PAC increase over the sensorimotor cortex has been observed consistently in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Its cause is attributed to neural entrainment in the basal ganglia, caused by pathological degeneration characteristic of PD. Disruptions in this phenomenon in PD patients have been observed in the resting state as well as during movement recordings and have reliably distinguished patients from healthy participants. The changes can be detected non-invasively with the electroencephalogram (EEG). They correspond to the severity of the motor symptoms and the medication status of people with PD. Furthermore, a medication-induced decrease in PAC in PD correlates with the alleviation of motor symptoms measured by assessment scales. A beta\u2013gamma PAC increase has, therefore, been explored as a possible means of quantifying motor pathology in PD. The application of this parameter to closed-loop deep brain stimulation could serve as a self-adaptation measure of such treatment, responding to fluctuations of motor symptom severity in PD. Furthermore, phase-dependent stimulation provides a new precise method for modulating PAC increases in the cortex. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the current EEG-based evidence on PAC fluctuations in PD, explores the potential practical utility of this biomarker, and provides recommendations for future research."

      "abstract": "Neural communication across different spatial and temporal scales is a topic of great interest in clinical and basic science. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has attracted particular interest due to its functional role in a wide range of cognitive and motor functions. Here, we introduce a novel measure termed the direct modulation index (dMI). Based on the classical modulation index, dMI provides an estimate of PAC that is bound to an absolute interval between 0 and +1, resistant against noise, and reliable even for small amounts of data. To highlight the properties of this newly-proposed measure, we evaluated dMI by comparing it to the classical modulation index, mean vector length, and phase-locking value using simulated data. We ascertained that dMI provides a more accurate estimate of PAC than the existing methods and that is resilient to varying noise levels and signal lengths. As such, dMI permits a reliable investigation of PAC, which may reveal insights crucial to our understanding of functional brain architecture in key contexts such as behaviour and cognition. A Python toolbox that implements dMI and other measures of PAC is freely available at https://github.com/neurophysiological-analysis/FiNN. Highlights - Neural coupling measures are sensitive to higher harmonics of the target oscillation. - dMI achieves frequency-specificity by sine-fitting the phase-amplitude histogram. - Increased robustness to noise and signal duration in comparison to other measures. - dMI allows for reliable estimation of phase-amplitude coupling."

Experimental findings are often puzzling and sometimes contradictory. Most computational models rely on pairs of pacemaker neurons or neural populations tuned at different frequencies to produce PAC. Here, using a data-driven model of a hippocampal microcircuit, we demonstrate that PAC can naturally emerge from a single feedback mechanism involving an inhibitory and excitatory neuron population, which interplay to generate theta frequency periodic bursts of higher frequency gamma. The model suggests the conditions under which a CA1 microcircuit can operate to elicit theta-gamma PAC, and highlights the modulatory role of OLM and PVBC cells, recurrent connectivity, and short term synaptic plasticity. Surprisingly, the results suggest the experimentally testable prediction that the generation of the slow population oscillation requires the fast one and cannot occur without it."

The processes that take place in specific areas of the brain during distinct sleep stages and specific respiratory events are suspected to be impaired in OSA patients. These brain processes may be described in complex (mathematical) terms. Using one of these descriptions (phase\u2013amplitude cross-frequency coupling), we demonstrated in electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of OSA patients that the process sequences in certain areas of the brain are altered in distinct sleep stages of OSA patients compared to patients who do not suffer from clinically relevant OSA. In addition, we were able to find a physiological marker that assesses the severity of daytime sleepiness, one of the main symptoms of OSA. This study supports the hypothesis that OSA is a neuronal/neuromuscular disorder. Thus, it contributes to a better understanding of the so-far-unexplained cause for the development of OSA and opens new possibilities for the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Abstract Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with sleep-stage- and respiratory-event-specific sensorimotor cortico-muscular disconnection. The modulation of phase\u2013amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PACFC) may influence information processing throughout the brain. We investigated whether sleep-stage-specific PACFC is impaired at the sensorimotor areas in OSA patients. C3 and C4 electrode EEG polysomnography recordings of 170 participants were evaluated. Different frequency band combinations were used to compute CFC modulation index (MI) to assess if MI differs between OSA and non-significant OSA patients in distinct sleep stages. We tested if the CFC-MI could predict daytime sleepiness in OSA. Theta\u2013gamma CFC-MI at cortical sensorimotor areas was significantly reduced during all sleep stages; the delta\u2013alpha CFC-MI was significantly reduced during REM and N1 while increasing during N2 in patients with respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 15/h compared to those with RDI \u2264 15/h. A sleep stage classification using MI values was achieved in both patient groups. Theta\u2013gamma MI during N2 and N3 could predict RDI and Epworth Sleepiness Scale, while delta\u2013alpha MI during REM predicted RDI. This increase in disconnection at the cortical sensorimotor areas with increasing respiratory distress during sleep supports a cortical motor dysfunction in OSA patients. The MI provides an objective marker to quantify subjective sleepiness and respiratory distress in OSA."

One particular form of interaction that is widely encountered is the modulation of the amplitude of broadband high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, defined as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Conventional methods for assessing PAC mostly rely on the Hilbert transform. Previous studies have shown that this method produces biased or spurious PAC estimates as it is highly dependent on the parameters of the bandpass filter used to extract narrowband signals from broadband signals. Recently, wavelet-based methods have been proposed to address some of these limitations. In this letter, we provide a thorough comparison between wavelet-based PAC measures and our recently introduced Reduced Interference Rihaczek (RID-Rihaczek) distribution based PAC both analytically and through simulations. The proposed method is shown to yield higher frequency resolution PAC estimates compared to wavelet-based methods."

      "abstract": "Introduction Electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities are seen in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with characteristic features of cognitive impairment. The most common findings of EEG features in AD and MCI patients are increased relative power of slow oscillations (delta and theta rhythms) and decreased relative power of fast oscillations (alpha, beta and gamma rhythms). However, impairments in cognitive processes in AD and MCI are not sufficiently reflected by brain oscillatory activity in a particular frequency band. MCI patients are at high risk of progressing to AD. Cross-frequency coupling (CFC), which refers to coupling between different frequency bands, is a crucial tool for comprehending changes in brain oscillations and cognitive performance. CFC features exhibit some specificity in patients with AD and MCI, but a comparison between CFC features in individuals with these disorders is still lacking. The aim of this study was to explore changes in CFC properties in MCI and AD and to explore the relationship between CFC properties and multiple types of cognitive functional performance. Methods We recorded resting-state EEG (rsEEG) signals in 46 MCI patients, 43 AD patients, and 43 cognitively healthy controls (HCs) and analyzed the changes in CFC as well as the relationship between CFC and scores on clinical tests of cognitive function. Results and discussion Multiple couplings between low-frequency oscillations and high-frequency oscillations were found to be significantly enhanced in AD patients compared to those of HCs and MCI, while delta-gamma as well as theta-gamma couplings in the right temporal and parietal lobes were significantly enhanced in MCI patients compared to HCs. Moreover, theta-gamma coupling in the right temporal lobe tended to be stronger in MCI patients than in HCs, and it was stronger in AD than in MCI. Multiple CFC properties were found to correlate significantly with various cognitive domains, especially the memory function domain. Overall, these findings suggest that AD and MCI patients must use more neural resources to maintain a resting brain state and that alterations in theta-gamma coupling in the temporal lobe become progressively obvious during disease progression and are likely to be a valuable indicator of MCI and AD pathology."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder caused by degeneration in dopaminergic neurons. During the disease course, most of PD patients develop mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI) and dementia, especially affecting frontal executive functions. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PDMCI patients may be characterized by abnormal neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms coupling frontal and posterior cortical areas during cognitive information processing. To test this hypothesis, event-related EEG oscillations (EROs) during counting visual target (rare) stimuli in an oddball task were recorded in healthy controls (HC; N\u2009=\u200951), cognitively unimpaired PD patients (N\u2009=\u200948), and PDMCI patients (N\u2009=\u200953). Hilbert transform served to estimate instantaneous phase and amplitude of EROs from delta to gamma frequency bands, while modulation index computed ERO phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) at electrode pairs. As compared to the HC and PD groups, the PDMCI group was characterized by (1) more posterior topography of the delta-theta PAC and (2) reversed delta-low frequency alpha PAC direction, ie, posterior-to-anterior rather than anterior-to-posterior. These results suggest that during cognitive demands, PDMCI patients are characterized by abnormal neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms mainly led by delta frequencies underpinning functional connectivity from frontal to parietal cortical areas."

      "abstract": "It has been suggested that cross-frequency coupling in cortico-hippocampal networks enables the maintenance of multiple visuo-spatial items in working memory. However, whether this mechanism acts as a global neural code for memory retention across sensory modalities remains to be demonstrated. Intracranial EEG data were recorded while drug-resistant patients with epilepsy performed a delayed matched-to-sample task with tone sequences. We manipulated task difficulty by varying the memory load and the duration of the silent retention period between the to-be-compared sequences. We show that the strength of theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling in the superior temporal sulcus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus, and the hippocampus (i) supports the short-term retention of auditory sequences; (ii) decodes correct and incorrect memory trials as revealed by machine learning analysis; and (iii) is positively correlated with individual short-term memory performance. Specifically, we show that successful task performance is associated with consistent phase coupling in these regions across participants, with gamma bursts restricted to specific theta phase ranges corresponding to higher levels of neural excitability. These findings highlight the role of cortico-hippocampal activity in auditory short-term memory and expand our knowledge about the role of cross-frequency coupling as a global biological mechanism for information processing, integration, and memory in the human brain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEmotions are thought to be related to distinct patterns of neural oscillations, but the interactions among multi-frequency neural oscillations during different emotional states lack full exploration. Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising tool for understanding the complexity of the neurophysiological system, thereby playing a crucial role in revealing the physiological mechanisms underlying emotional electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the non-sinusoidal characteristics of EEG lead to the non-uniform distribution of phase angles, which could potentially affect the analysis of phase-amplitude coupling. Removing phase clustering bias (PCB) can uniform the distribution of phase angles, but the effect of this approach is unknown on emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling. This study aims to explore the effect of PCB on cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling for emotional EEG.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe technique of removing PCB was implemented on a publicly accessible emotional EEG dataset to calculate debiased phase-amplitude coupling. Statistical analysis and classification were conducted to compare the difference in emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling prior to and post the removal of PCB.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEmotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling values are overestimated due to PCB. Removing PCB enhances the difference in coupling strength between fear and happy emotions in the frontal lobe. Comparable emotion recognition performance was achieved with fewer features after removing PCB.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that removing PCB enhances the difference in emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling patterns and generates features that contain more emotional information. Removing PCB may be advantageous for analyzing emotional EEG phase-amplitude coupling and recognizing human emotions."

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for monitoring the depth of anesthesia in surgical patients. Distinguishing age-related EEG features under general anesthesia will help to optimize anesthetic depth monitoring during surgery for elderly patients. This retrospective cohort study included 41 patients aged from 18 to 79 years undergoing noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia. We compared the power spectral signatures and phase\u2013amplitude coupling patterns of the young and elderly groups under baseline and surgical anesthetic depth. General anesthesia by sevoflurane significantly increased the spectral power of delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands and strengthened the cross-frequency coupling both in young and elderly patients. However, the variation in EEG power spectral density and the modulation of alpha amplitudes on delta phases was relatively weaker in elderly patients. In conclusion, the EEG under general anesthesia using sevoflurane exhibited similar dynamic features between young and elderly patients, and the weakened alteration of spectral power and cross-frequency coupling patterns could be utilized to precisely quantify the depth of anesthesia in elderly patients."

      "abstract": "The relationship between working memory (WM) and neuronal oscillations can be studied in detail using brain stimulation techniques, which provide a method for modulating these oscillations and thus influencing WM. The endogenous coupling between the amplitude of gamma oscillations and the phase of theta oscillations is crucial for cognitive control. Theta/gamma peak-coupled transcranial alternating current stimulation (TGCp-tACS) can modulate this coupling and thus influence WM performance. This study investigated the effects of TGCp-tACS on WM in older adults and compared their responses with those of younger participants from our previous work who underwent the same experimental design. Twenty-eight older subjects underwent both TGCp-tACS and sham stimulation sessions at least 72 h apart. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after the interventions, and a WM task battery with five different WM tasks was performed during the interventions to assess various WM components. Outcomes measured included WM task performance (e.g., accuracy, reaction time (RT)) and changes in power spectral density (PSD) in different frequency bands. TGCp-tACS significantly decreased accuracy and RT on the 10- and 14-point Sternberg tasks and increased RT on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test in older adults. In contrast, younger participants showed a significant increase in accuracy only on the 14-item Sternberg task. Electrophysiological analysis revealed a decrease in delta and theta PSD and an increase in high gamma PSD in both younger and older participants after verum stimulation. In conclusion, theta-gamma coupling is essential for WM and modulation of this coupling affects WM performance. The effects of TGCp-tACS on WM vary with age due to natural brain changes. To better support older adults, the study suggests several strategies to improve cognitive function, including: Adjusting stimulation parameters, applying stimulation to two sites, conducting multiple sessions, and using brain imaging techniques for precise targeting."

      "abstract": "The escalating global burden of age-related neurodegenerative diseases and associated healthcare costs necessitates innovative interventions to stabilize or enhance cognitive functions. Deficits in working memory (WM) are linked to alterations in prefrontal theta\u2013gamma cross-frequency coupling. Low-intensity transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has emerged as a non-invasive, low-cost approach capable of modulating ongoing oscillations in targeted brain areas through entrainment. This study investigates the impact of multi-session peak-coupled theta\u2013gamma cross-frequency tACS administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on WM performance in older adults. In a randomized, sham-controlled, triple-blinded design, 77 participants underwent 16 stimulation sessions over six weeks while performing n-back tasks. Signal detection measures revealed increased 2-back sensitivity and robust modulations of response bias, indicating improved WM and decision-making adaptations, respectively. No effects were observed in the 1-back condition, emphasizing dependencies on cognitive load. Repeated tACS reinforces behavioral changes, indicated by increasing effect sizes. This study supports prior research correlating prefrontal theta\u2013gamma coupling with WM processes and provides unique insights into the neurocognitive benefits of repeated tACS intervention. The well-tolerated and highly effective multi-session tACS intervention among the elderly underscores its therapeutic potential in vulnerable populations.

      "abstract": "Accurate monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (DOA) is essential to ensure the safety of the operation. In this study, a new index using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signal was proposed to assess the relationship between the DOA and cerebral hemodynamic variables. Methods: Four cerebral hemodynamic variables of 15 patients were collected, including left, right, proximal, distal, oxygenated (HbO $_{{2}}{)}$ and deoxygenated (Hb) hemoglobin concentration changes. The Phase-Amplitude coupling (PAC), an adaptation of cross-frequency coupling to reflect the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency signals by the phase of low-frequency signals, was measured and the modulation index (MI) was obtained to monitor the DOA afterwards. Meanwhile, the BIS value based on electroencephalogram is also measured and compared. Results: Compared with awake period, in anesthesia maintenance period, the PAC was strengthened. The analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the MI, especially the MI of rp-HbO2, could effectively discriminate these two periods. Additionally, during the whole anesthesia process, the BIS value was statistically consistent with the MI of cerebral hemodynamic variables, and cerebral hemodynamic variables were immune from interference by clinical electric devices. Conclusion: The MI of cerebral hemodynamic variables was appropriate to be used as a new index to monitor the DOA. Significance: This study is of great significance to the development of new modes of anesthesia monitoring and new decoding methods, and is expected to develop a high-performance anesthesia monitoring system."

It is of particular importance to understand how they are distributed among different neuroanatomical and physiological relevant brain regions. We investigated neural cross-frequency couplings between different brain regions according to the Desikan-Killiany brain parcellation. The adaptive dynamic Bayesian inference method was applied to EEG measurements of healthy resting subjects in order to reconstruct the coupling functions. It was found that even after averaging over all subjects, the mean coupling function showed a characteristic waveform, confirming the direct influence of the delta-phase on the alpha-phase dynamics in certain brain regions and that the shape of the coupling function changes for different regions. While the averaged coupling function within a region was of similar form, the region-averaged coupling function was averaged out, which implies that there is a common dependence within separate regions across the subjects. It was also found that for certain regions the influence of delta on alpha oscillations is more pronounced and that oscillations that influence other are more evenly distributed across brain regions than the influenced oscillations. When presenting the information on brain lobes, it was shown that the influence of delta emanating from the brain as a whole is greatest on the alpha oscillations of the cingulate frontal lobe, and at the same time the influence of delta from the cingulate parietal brain lobe is greatest on the alpha oscillations of the whole brain."

      "abstract": "Background The application of neuroimaging-based biomarkers in stroke has enriched our understanding of post-stroke recovery mechanisms, including alterations in functional connectivity based on synchronous oscillatory activity across various cortical regions. Phase-amplitude coupling, a type of cross-frequency coupling, may provide additional mechanistic insight. Objective To determine how the phase of prefrontal cortex delta (1-3\u2009Hz) oscillatory activity mediates the amplitude of motor cortex beta (13-20\u2009Hz) oscillations in individual\u2019s early post-stroke. Methods Participants admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility completed resting and task-based EEG recordings and motor assessments around the time of admission and discharge along with structural neuroimaging. Unimpaired controls completed EEG procedures during a single visit. Mixed-effects linear models were performed to assess within- and between-group differences in delta-beta prefrontomotor coupling. Associations between coupling and motor status and injury were also determined. Results Thirty individuals with stroke and 17 unimpaired controls participated. Coupling was greater during task versus rest conditions for all participants. Though coupling during affected extremity task performance decreased during hospitalization, coupling remained elevated at discharge compared to controls. Greater baseline coupling was associated with better motor status at admission and discharge and positively related to motor recovery. Coupling demonstrated both positive and negative associations with injury involving measures of lesion volume and overlap injury to anterior thalamic radiation, respectively. Conclusions This work highlights the utility of prefrontomotor cross-frequency coupling as a potential motor status and recovery biomarker in stroke. The frequency- and region-specific neurocircuitry featured in this work may also facilitate novel treatment strategies in stroke."

In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), preliminary evidence indicates abnormal beta-phase coupling to gamma-amplitude in different brain areas, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN). We analyzed bilateral STN local field potentials (LFPs) in eight subjects with PD chronically implanted with deep brain stimulation electrodes during upright quiet standing and unperturbed walking. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was computed using the Kullback-Liebler method, based on the modulation index. Neurophysiological recordings were correlated with clinical and kinematic measurements and individual molecular brain imaging studies ([123I]FP-CIT and single-photon emission computed tomography). We showed a dopamine-related increase in subthalamic beta-gamma PAC from standing to walking. Patients with poor PAC modulation and low PAC during walking spent significantly more time in the stance and double support phase of the gait cycle. Our results provide new insights into the subthalamic contribution to human gait and suggest cross-frequency coupling as a gateway mechanism to convey patient-specific information of motor control for human locomotion."

      "abstract": "Epilepsy, a chronic neuropsychiatric brain disorder characterized with recurrent seizures, is closely associated with abnormal neural communications within the brain. Despite that the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has been suggested to offer a new way to observe neural interactions during epilepsy, however, few studies pay attention to alterations of the epileptic functional brain network based on PAC, especially on the $\\boldsymbol{\\upbeta\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\upgamma}$ PAC. Therefore, we use scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data of epileptic patients and the $\\boldsymbol{\\upbeta\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\upgamma}$ PAC modulation index (MI) to construct functional brain networks to examine variations of neural interactions during different epileptic phases. Statistically, the findings show that between-channel MI values in the post-ictal period significantly increase compared to that in the pre-ictal period, and the between-channel MI value has a close association with the information of phase and amplitude provided by the channels. Importantly, in both the phase-amplitude and amplitude-phase functional brain networks, the average node degree is remarkably higher in the post-ictal period than that in the pre-ictal period, whereas the characteristic path length in the ictal and post-ictal periods is significantly lower than that in the pre-ictal period. Besides, the average betweenness centrality in the post-ictal period is remarkably higher than that in the ictal period. Interestingly, the positive correlations between within-channel MI values and between-channel MI values can be observed during the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal periods. These findings suggest that the $\\boldsymbol{\\upbeta\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\upgamma}$ PAC-based functional brain network may provide a novel perspective to understanding alterations of neural interactions during the epileptic evolution, and may contribute to effectively controlling the spread of epileptic seizures."

One of the best-studied cross-frequency couplings is theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling that contributes to the cognitive function and may vary in patients with several conditions associated with cognitive impairment. Changes in theta-gamma coupling can be registered in a wide range of diseases associated with cognitive decline. \nThe review covers the physiological basics of theta-gamma coupling, its registration and calculation, correlation with cognitive test results in healthy volunteers, and changes in patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic pattern changes during anesthesia reflect the nociception-analgesia balance. Alpha dropout, delta arousal, and beta arousal with noxious stimulation have been described during anesthesia; however, data on the reaction of other electroencephalogram signatures toward nociception are scarce. Analyzing the effects of nociception on different electroencephalogram signatures may help us find new nociception markers in anesthesia and understand the neurophysiology of pain in the brain. This study aimed to analyze the electroencephalographic frequency pattern and phase-amplitude coupling change during laparoscopic surgeries. METHODS: This study evaluated 34 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. The electroencephalogram frequency band power and phase-amplitude coupling of different frequencies were analyzed across 3 stages of laparoscopy: incision, insufflation, and opioid stages. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with a mixed model and the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons were used to analyze the changes in the electroencephalogram signatures between the preincision and postincision/postinsufflation/postopioid phases. RESULTS: During noxious stimulation, the frequency spectrum showed obvious decreases in the alpha power percentage after the incision (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean [SEM], 26.27 \u00b1 0.44 and 24.37 \u00b1 0.66; P < .001) and insufflation stages (26.27 \u00b1 0.44 and 24.40 \u00b1 0.68; P = .002), which recovered after opioid administration. Further phase-amplitude analyses showed that the modulation index (MI) of the delta-alpha coupling decreased after the incision stage (1.83 \u00b1 0.22 and 0.98 \u00b1 0.14 [MI \u00d7 103]; P < .001), continued to be suppressed during the insufflation stage (1.83 \u00b1 0.22 and 1.17 \u00b1 0.15 [MI \u00d7 103]; P = .044), and recovered after opioid administration. CONCLUSIONS: Alpha dropout during noxious stimulation is observed in laparoscopic surgeries under sevoflurane. In addition, the modulation index of delta-alpha coupling decreases during noxious stimulation and recovers after the administration of rescue opioids. Phase-amplitude coupling of the electroencephalogram may be a new approach for evaluating the nociception-analgesia balance during anesthesia."

      "abstract": "Gamma oscillations nested in a theta rhythm are observed in the hippocampus, where are assumed to play a role in sequential episodic memory, i.e., memorization and retrieval of events that unfold in time. In this work, we present an original neurocomputational model based on neural masses, which simulates the encoding of sequences of events in the hippocampus and subsequent retrieval by exploiting the theta-gamma code. The model is based on a three-layer structure in which individual Units oscillate with a gamma rhythm and code for individual features of an episode. The first layer (working memory in the prefrontal cortex) maintains a cue in memory until a new signal is presented. The second layer (CA3 cells) implements an auto-associative memory, exploiting excitatory and inhibitory plastic synapses to recover an entire episode from a single feature. Units in this layer are disinhibited by a theta rhythm from an external source (septum or Papez circuit). The third layer (CA1 cells) implements a hetero-associative net with the previous layer, able to recover a sequence of episodes from the first one. During an encoding phase, simulating high-acetylcholine levels, the network is trained with Hebbian (synchronizing) and anti-Hebbian (desynchronizing) rules. During retrieval (low-acetylcholine), the network can correctly recover sequences from an initial cue using gamma oscillations nested inside the theta rhythm. Moreover, in high noise, the network isolated from the environment simulates a mind-wandering condition, randomly replicating previous sequences. Interestingly, in a state simulating sleep, with increased noise and reduced synapses, the network can \u201cdream\u201d by creatively combining sequences, exploiting features shared by different episodes. Finally, an irrational behavior (erroneous superimposition of features in various episodes, like \u201cdelusion\u201d) occurs after pathological-like reduction in fast inhibitory synapses. The model can represent a straightforward and innovative tool to help mechanistically understand the theta-gamma code in different mental states."

      "abstract": "Background Theta-gamma coupling (TGC) plays a critical role in working memory (WM) processing, yet it is often dysregulated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While gamma activity is known to support cognitive functions, excessive gamma activity in MCI may impair WM. This study investigates how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates gamma activity by regulating TGC to enhance WM in MCI patients. Objectives This study aims to explore the effects of rTMS on WM by targeting TGC and reducing occipital gamma activity under varying WM loads. Methods We recruited 34 participants, including 20 MCI patients and 14 healthy elderly controls (HC), from Shanghai Tongji Hospital. All participants received a 1 week intervention of 10 Hz rTMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Gamma power and TGC were measured using electroencephalography (EEG), and WM performance (accuracy, capacity, reaction time) was assessed through a visual WM paradigm. Results The rTMS intervention significantly reduced gamma power in left occipital region, correlating with improved WM performance (enhanced accuracy, capacity, and faster reaction time). Changes in TGC between left frontal theta and occipital gamma oscillations were significantly associated with WM performance, indicating a neurocognitive link. Conclusion This study highlights rTMS as a non-invasive tool for enhancing WM by modulating TGC and reducing gamma power. These findings suggest a promising strategy for improving cognitive function in MCI, with significant clinical implications for cognitive optimization and therapeutic interventions."

By examining specific EEG dynamics associated with dreaming, specifically delta and gamma power during phasic REM sleep states and their correlation with iRBD characteristics, we aim to develop a comprehensive understanding of dream enactment.\n \n \n \n In-depth analysis was performed using polysomnography (PSG) and 21-channel EEG data from 13 iRBD patients and 10 controls who had been drug-free for six months and had not progressed to alpha-synucleinopathy. REM sleep states were categorized into phasic and tonic states based on eye movements, and the Kullback-Leibler modulation index was used to assess phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and calculated phase-locked amplitudes (PLA) to determine interphase coupling. Gini coefficients were calculated to identify within- and between-component imbalances, and extensive statistical analysis was performed using permutation cluster analysis, repeated measures analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U tests, and correlation assessments to identify differences and relationships.\n \n \n \n The results showed a significant increase in delta-gamma coupling during phasic REM sleep in RBD compared to controls (FDR p < 0.0001). A detailed comparison of the delta signal component, the component in which the imbalance was found (FDR p < 0.0001), at different spatial locations revealed distinct patterns of delta-gamma coupling, with significant phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) observed in frontal and parietal cortex. These results showed a clear linear relationship (FDR p < 0.0001), with notable correlations with the RBDQ-KR (FDR p < 0.0001) and the REM atonia index (FDR p=0.0003). The average area under the ROC-AUC curve for separating the RBD group from the control group based on PAC values was 0.88.\n \n \n \n The study significantly highlights the role of EEG metrics, especially the coupling of delta and gamma oscillation during REM sleep, as key indicators of dream-related enactment in iRBD. The strong correlations with clinical indices not only underscore the diagnostic value of these EEG measures but also suggest their potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and understanding of iRBD.\n \n \n \n \u00a0\n"

      "abstract": "Background Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the phase of low-frequency signals and the amplitude of high-frequency activities plays many physiological roles and is involved in the pathological processed of various neurological disorders. However, how low-frequency and high-frequency neural oscillations or information synchronization activities change under chronic central hypoxia in OSA patients and whether these changes are closely associated with OSA remains largely unexplored. This study arm to elucidate the long-term consequences of OSA-related oxygen deprivation on central nervous system function. Methods : We screened 521 patients who were clinically suspected of having OSA at our neurology and sleep centers. Through polysomnography (PSG) and other clinical examinations, 103 patients were ultimately included in the study and classified into mild, moderate, and severe OSA groups based on the severity of hypoxia determined by PSG. We utilized the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) method to analyze the modulation index (MI) trends between different frequency bands during NREM (N1/N2/N3), REM, and wakefulness stages in OSA patients with varying severity levels. We also examined the correlation between the MI index and OSA hypoxia indices. Results Apart from reduced N2 sleep duration and increased microarousal index, the sleep architecture remained largely unchanged among OSA patients with varying severity levels. Compared to the mild OSA group, patients with moderate and severe OSA exhibited higher MI values of PAC in the low-frequency theta phase and high-frequency beta amplitude in the frontal and occipital regions during N1 sleep and wakefulness. No significant differences in the MI of phase-amplitude coupling were observed during N2/3 and REM sleep. Moreover, the MI of phase-amplitude coupling in theta and beta bands positively correlated with hypoxia-related indices, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygenation desaturation index (ODI), and the percentage of oxygen saturation below 90% (SaO2<90%). Conclusion OSA patients demonstrated increased MI values of theta phase and beta amplitude in the frontal and occipital regions during N1 sleep and wakefulness. This suggests that cortical coupling is prevalent and exhibits sleep-stage-specific patterns in OSA. Theta-beta PAC during N1 and wakefulness was positively correlated with hypoxia-related indices, suggesting a potential relationship between these neural oscillations and OSA severity. The present study provides new insights into the relationship between neural oscillations and respiratory hypoxia in OSA patients."

      "abstract": "Objectives. The purpose of this study is to investigate the age dependence of bilateral frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) coupling characteristics, and find potential age-independent depth of anesthesia monitoring indicators for the elderlies. Approach. We recorded bilateral forehead EEG data from 41 patients (ranged in 19\u201382 years old), and separated into three age groups: 18\u201340 years (n = 12); 40\u201365 years (n = 14), >65 years (n = 15). All these patients underwent desflurane maintained general anesthesia (GA). We analyzed the age-related EEG spectra, phase amplitude coupling (PAC), coherence and phase lag index (PLI) of EEG data in the states of awake, GA, and recovery. Main results. The frontal alpha power shows age dependence in the state of GA maintained by desflurane. Modulation index in slow oscillation-alpha and delta-alpha bands showed age dependence and state dependence in varying degrees, the PAC pattern also became less pronounced with increasing age. In the awake state, the coherence in delta, theta and alpha frequency bands were all significantly higher in the >65 years age group than in the 18\u201340 years age group (p< 0.05 for three frequency bands). The coherence in alpha-band was significantly enhanced in all age groups in GA (p < 0.01) and then decreased in recovery state. Notably, the PLI in the alpha band was able to significantly distinguish the three states of awake, GA and recovery (p< 0.01) and the results of PLI in delta and theta frequency bands had similar changes to those of coherence. Significance. We found the EEG coupling and synchronization between bilateral forehead are age-dependent. The PAC, coherence and PLI portray this age-dependence. The PLI and coherence based on bilateral frontal EEG functional connectivity measures and PAC based on frontal single-channel are closely associated with anesthesia-induced unconsciousness."

The phase amplitude coupling (PAC) relationship between the 11th (4.57 Hz) and 17th (0.4 Hz) scale was investigated. Correlations were examined between the 11th and 17th scale EEG signals in different leads during seizure, using multi-scale cross correlation analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time-frequency structure of JME subjects showed strong rhythmic activity in the 11th and 17th scales and a close PAC was identified. Correlation analysis revealed that the ictal JME correlation first increased in the anterior head early in seizure and gradually expanded to the posterior head.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPAC was exhibited between the 11th and 17th scales during JME seizure. The results revealed that the correlation in the anterior leads was higher than the posterior leads. In the perictal period, the 17th scale EEG signal preceded the 11th scale signal and remained for some time after a seizure. This suggests that the 17th scale signal may play an important role in JME seizure."

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a fatal disease of the nervous system that affects a big part of the world's population. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the tool that is most often used in clinical settings to measure how the brain works. EEG is often used to diagnose and treat a wide range of health problems, such as mental exhaustion, epileptic seizures, coma, schizophrenia, and sleep problems. The large dimensionality of data is one of the problems with epilepsy detection that is discussed in this work. When attempting to analyze the data, a high dimensionality might be problematic. The primary purpose of lowering the dimensionality of the EEG data is to augment the classification results. In this paper, the dimensionality of the EEG data can be reduced by the use of procedures such as dimensionality reduction and feature selection. For dimensionality reduction, the autoencoder and Hessian LLE method are employed. As a technique of feature selection, the PAC Bayesian algorithm is employed. Logistic Regression classifier is used to detect epilepsy. Results show that the when Hessian LLE with PAC-Bayesian is identified with logistic regression gives the best accuracy of 96.87%."

      "abstract": "Theta-Gamma Coupling (TGC) has been identified over the past decade as a stable biomarker of information ordering during the performance of working memory tasks, such as the N -back task. Previous research also suggests that reducing prefrontal cortical theta phase-gamma amplitude coupling (TGC) is an early indicator of cognitive impairment. This study aimed to reaffirm the relationship between TGC and accuracy during the N-back working memory task and to establish a relationship between TGC and performance in a healthy population during the Digit Span and Corsi Span working memory tasks, which require ordering information in different formats. Thirty-six healthy participants (18 males and 18 females; mean age: 23.64, SD: 3.85) were recruited. The results of this study demonstrate a statistically significant positive correlation between TGC and performance across all three tasks using Spearman's and Pearson's correlation analyses. Results: N-back-Spearman's correlation $(\\rho=0.46,p= 0.006)$, Pearson's correlation (p= 0.37, p = 0.033); Digit Span task-Spearman's correlation $(\\rho= 0.56, p = 0.001)$, Pearson's correlation $(\\rho=0.51,p= 0.014)$ and Corsi-Span task-Spearman's correlation $(\\rho=0.44, p=0.016)$, Pearson's correlation $(\\rho=0.46,\\ \\mathrm{p}=0.004)$. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were found in TGC for all three tasks based on Gender. Conclusion: The results of this study provide direct evidence of a relationship between Theta-Gamma Coupling and performance during working memory tasks that require information ordering, reaffirming its stability as a neurophysiological biomarker for working memory and its potential in detecting cognitive impairment."

      "abstract": "Background Theta-gamma coupling (TGC) describes the modulation of gamma oscillations by the theta phasic activity, which is crucial for processes such as the ordering of information during working memory (WM) performance. The mental arithmetic (MA), which involves performing calculations with numbers, is a crucial tool for evaluating and understanding the sensory processing and management abilities of WM. Evaluating TGC may provide greater insight into the neural mechanisms mediating WM deficits in panic disorder (PD). Methods Medical and electroencephalography (EEG) records of psychiatric outpatient clinic between 1 March 2020 and 30 September 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 34 PD patients and 34 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent EEG to assess the overall functional interaction of the brain using multi-channel EEG analysis, focusing on specific brain regions including the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. EEG recordings were conducted during two sessions: a 5-min eyes-closed resting-state (RS) and a subsequent 5-min eyes-closed MA. The TGC and the spectral power of the theta and gamma frequency bands, which are well known to be associated with WM, were analysed. Results Compared to those in HCs, TGC and theta power were significantly attenuated in PD patients. When analysing both HCs and PD patients together, RS TGC and relative theta power were negatively correlated with state anxiety and perceived stress scores, respectively. In contrast, TGC and relative theta power during the MA condition were positively correlated with the MA performance. Specifically, in PD patients, RS theta power across all electrodes was significantly negatively correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score. Linear regression analysis revealed that theta power in the T5 channel remained negatively correlated with pathological anxiety as measured by the HAMA score, even after controlling for other confounding factors. Conclusions This study highlights significant alterations in TGC and theta power in PD patients. PD patients exhibit reduced TGC and theta power compared to HCs, indicating deficits in the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety and/or WM in PD. These insights contribute to a better understanding of the neural basis of WM deficits in PD and suggest potential avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.

      "abstract": "Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is proposed to play an essential role in coordinating the processing of information on local and global scales. In recent years, the methods able to reveal trustworthy PAC has gained considerable interest. However, the intrinsic features of some signals can lead to the identification of spurious or waveform-dependent coupling. This prompted us to develop an easily accessible tool that could be used to differentiate spurious from authentic PAC. Here, we propose a new tool for more reliable detection of PAC named the Extended Modulation Index (eMI) based on the classical Modulation Index measure of coupling. eMI is suitable both for continuous and epoched data and allows estimation of the statistical significance of each pair of frequencies for phase and for amplitude in the whole comodulogram in the framework of extreme value statistics. We compared eMI with the reference PAC measures\u2014direct PAC estimator (a modification of Mean Vector Length) and standard Modulation Index. All three methods were tested using computer-simulated data and actual local field potential recordings from freely moving rats. All methods exhibited similar properties in terms of sensitivity and specificity of PAC detection. eMI proved to be more selective in the dimension of frequency for phase. One of the novelty\u2019s offered by eMI is a heuristic algorithm for classification of PAC as Reliable or Ambiguous. It relies on analysis of the relation between the spectral properties of the signal and the detected coupling. Moreover, eMI generates visualizations that support further evaluation of the coupling properties. It also introduces the concept of the polar phase-histogram to study phase relations of coupled slow and fast oscillations. We discuss the extent to which eMI addresses the known problems of interpreting PAC. The Matlab\u00ae toolbox implementing eMI framework, and the two reference PAC estimators is freely available as EEGLAB plugin at https://github.com/GabrielaJurkiewicz/ePAC."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is now the second most prevalent chronic neurological illness worldwide. For motor symptoms of PD, PD is linked to a number of dyskinesia, including rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, and tremor at rest. PD dyskinesia is the most common cause of Parkinsonism. Meanwhile, PD dyskinesia may be closely linked to the neural oscillations between neural circuits. PD dyskinesia is associated, in particular, with beta oscillation, which is directly related to the incidence and development of the motor. For the purpose of analysing neural oscillations between neural circuits, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) can be utilised as a biomarker. As a potential biomarker of beta oscillation, PAC has been widely used in the research of PD. Therefore, this article reviews the latest concepts of dyskinesia, methods of calculating PAC and applications of PAC in Parkinson's disease, aiming to provide a good theoretical basis for finding neural circuits involved in PD dyskinesia to establish better deep brain stimulation therapy."

      "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) frequently involves an intricate, extensive epileptic frontal\u2010temporal network. This study aimed to investigate the interactions between temporal and frontal regions and the dynamic patterns of the frontal\u2010temporal network in TLE patients with different disease durations. The magnetoencephalography data of 36 postoperative seizure\u2010free patients with long\u2010term follow\u2010up of at least 1\u2009year, and 21 age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched healthy subjects were included in this study. Patients were initially divided into LONG\u2010TERM (n\u2009=\u200918, DURATION >10\u2009years) and SHORT\u2010TERM (n\u2009=\u200918, DURATION \u226410\u2009years) groups based on 10\u2010year disease duration. For reliability, supplementary analyses were conducted with alternative cutoffs, creating three groups: 0\u2009<\u2009DURATION \u22647\u2009years (n\u2009=\u200911), 7\u2009<\u2009DURATION \u226414\u2009years (n\u2009=\u200911), and DURATION >14\u2009years (n\u2009=\u200914). This study examined the intraregional phase\u2010amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta phase and alpha amplitude across the whole brain. The interregional directed phase transfer entropy (dPTE) between frontal and temporal regions in the alpha and theta bands, and the interregional cross\u2010frequency directionality (CFD) between temporal and frontal regions from the theta phase to the alpha amplitude were further computed and compared among groups. Partial correlation analysis was conducted to investigate correlations between intraregional PAC, interregional dPTE connectivity, interregional CFD, and disease duration. Whole\u2010brain intraregional PAC analyses revealed enhanced theta phase\u2010alpha amplitude coupling within the ipsilateral temporal and frontal regions in TLE patients, and the ipsilateral temporal PAC was positively correlated with disease duration (r\u2009=\u20090.38, p\u2009<.05). Interregional dPTE analyses demonstrated a gradual increase in frontal\u2010to\u2010temporal connectivity within the alpha band, while the direction of theta\u2010band connectivity reversed from frontal\u2010to\u2010temporal to temporal\u2010to\u2010frontal as the disease duration increased. Interregional CFD analyses revealed that the inhibitory effect of frontal regions on temporal regions gradually increased with prolonged disease duration (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.36, p\u2009<.05). This study clarified the intrinsic reciprocal connectivity between temporal and frontal regions with TLE duration. We propose a dynamically reorganized triple\u2010stage network that transitions from balanced networks to constrained networks and further develops into imbalanced networks as the disease duration increases."

Previous studies have shown that the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) can be used as a potential biomarker for locating epileptic zones and characterizing the transition of epileptic phases. However, in contrast to the \u03b8-\u03b3 coupling widely investigated in epilepsy, few studies have paid attention to the \u03b2-\u03b3 coupling, as well as its potential applications. In the current study, we use the modulation index (MI) to calculate the scalp electroencephalography (EEG)-based \u03b2-\u03b3 coupling and investigate the corresponding changes during different epileptic phases. The results show that the \u03b2-\u03b3 coupling of each brain region changes with the evolution of epilepsy, and in several brain regions, the \u03b2-\u03b3 coupling decreases during the ictal period but increases in the post-ictal period, where the differences are statistically significant. Moreover, the alterations of \u03b2-\u03b3 coupling between different brain regions can also be observed, and the strength of \u03b2-\u03b3 coupling increases in the post-ictal period, where the differences are also significant. Taken together, these findings not only contribute to understanding neural interactions within the brain during the evolution of epilepsy, but also provide a new insight into the clinical treatment."

Method: Drawing inspiration from Riemannian geometry and Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC), this paper introduces a novel approach termed Riemann Tangent Space Mapping using Dichotomous Filter Bank with Convolutional Neural Network (DFBRTS) to enhance the representation quality and decoding capability pertaining to MI features. DFBRTS first initiates the process by meticulously filtering EEG signals through a Dichotomous Filter Bank, structured in the fashion of a complete binary tree. Subsequently, it employs Riemann Tangent Space Mapping to extract salient EEG signal features within each sub-band. Finally, a lightweight convolutional neural network is employed for further feature extraction and classification, operating under the joint supervision of cross-entropy and center loss. To validate the efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted using DFBRTS on two well-established benchmark datasets: the BCI competition IV 2a (BCIC-IV-2a) dataset and the OpenBMI dataset. The performance of DFBRTS was benchmarked against several state-of-the-art MI decoding methods, alongside other Riemannian geometry-based MI decoding approaches. Results: DFBRTS significantly outperforms other MI decoding algorithms on both datasets, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 78.16% for four-class and 71.58% for two-class hold-out classification, as compared to the existing benchmarks."

The experimental results agree with the theoretical prediction that cross-frequency coupling results in a partition of the brain synchrony state space. We place these results in the framework of the integration and segregation of information in the processing of sensorimotor transformations by the brain cell circuits and propose that equal frequency (1:1) connectivity favours integration of information in the brain whereas cross-frequency coupling (n:m) favours segregation. These observations may provide an outlook about how to reconcile the need for stability in the brain\u2019s operations with the requirement for diversity of activity in order to process many sensorimotor transformations simultaneously."

      "abstract": "Abstract The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis requires identifying degeneration in both brain and bulbospinal motor neurons. However, detecting cortical dysfunction remains challenging, as peripheral symptoms often overshadow upper motor neuron signs. Although transcranial magnetic stimulation and MRI are valuable tools, transcranial magnetic stimulation is challenged as disease progresses but also at early stage in some patients, and brain MRI shows in most cohorts no significant change at the time of diagnosis. This emphasizes the need for neuromarkers facilitating detection of cortical dysfunction and longitudinal monitoring. EEG offers promising avenues. Accordingly, we recently identified altered theta-gamma phase\u2013amplitude coupling in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study aimed to further explore phase\u2013amplitude coupling in patients, focusing not only on theta and gamma bands but also on alpha and beta bands, and the link with handedness and brain structure. Resting-state EEG was recorded in 26 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 26 age- and sex-matched controls, alongside anatomical and diffusion MRI. PAC was calculated between slow and gamma oscillations at five sensorimotor electrodes bilaterally. Grey and white matter integrity was evaluated through cortical thickness measurements and diffusion metrics along the corticospinal tract. Results revealed significantly decreased theta-gamma PAC in the dominant hemisphere of patients, without changes in band powers or other frequency couplings. MRI confirmed well-known handedness-related brain structural asymmetry in both groups, although it was less pronounced in patients. Specifically, diffusion metrics were altered in the most caudal segment (brainstem level) of the pyramidal tract within the dominant hemisphere in patients. These findings align with lateralized theta-gamma PAC alterations and the greater vulnerability of the dominant hemisphere to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. No correlation was found between electrophysiological and diffusion metrics, likely because they are related to different mechanisms: PAC alteration being presumably linked to excitation/inhibition imbalance preceding upper motor neuron degeneration. Moreover, theta\u2013gamma PAC was found to be particularly altered in patients with altered cognitive scores, consistent with previous findings in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Lastly, receiver operating characteristic analyses demonstrated that PAC outperformed diffusion MRI in diagnostic accuracy, underscoring its potential as a very sensitive marker of cortical dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although these results need validation in a larger cohort at different stages of the disease and across different forms (sporadic and familial), they confirm that PAC can detect cortical dysfunctions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
