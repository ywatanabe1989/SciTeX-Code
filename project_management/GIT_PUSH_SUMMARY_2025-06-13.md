## Major Changes Summary

### 1. GIF Support Investigation & Implementation
- **Issue**: GIF support was missing during mngs â†’ scitex migration

- **Resolution**: Full GIF support added to scitex _image.py module
- **Supports**: PIL Images, Plotly figures, Matplotlib figures

### 2. Critical Bug Fix: Missing Files

- **Impact**: Entire _save_modules directory was missing
- **Resolution**: Merged scitex-initial branch to restore all files
- **Result**: Save functionality fully restored

### 3. Repository Structure
- **Current State**: Both src/mngs/ and src/scitex/ directories coexist
- **Migration Path**: Gradual transition from mngs to scitex naming
- **Compatibility**: Both import paths currently work

### 4. Additional Improvements
- Import error handling added to AI modules
- Comprehensive documentation created
- Test coverage improvements (from previous sessions)
