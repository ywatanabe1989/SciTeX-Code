# Notebook Execution Status Report
**Date**: 2025-07-04  
**Agent**: cd929c74-58c6-11f0-8276-00155d3c097c

## Current Status
After completing Priority 10 notebook cleanup, only 1 out of 25 notebooks executes successfully.

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ Removed all notebook variants (91+ files)
2. ✅ Removed 184 print statements
3. ✅ Fixed JSON format issues
4. ✅ Fixed incomplete except blocks
5. ✅ Fixed incomplete else/elif blocks

## Remaining Issues
The notebooks have complex indentation errors that resulted from the automated cleanup process:
- Empty for loops without body
- Nested blocks with incorrect indentation
- Mixed indentation from multiple automated fixes

## Example Error
```
Cell In[9], line 35
    except ImportError:
                       ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line 33
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The automated removal of print statements and fixing of incomplete blocks has created new indentation issues where:
1. Loops that only contained print statements now have no body
2. Conditional blocks are missing required indented content
3. Multiple layers of fixes have compounded the problem

## Recommendation
The notebooks require manual review and repair rather than automated fixes. The complexity of the indentation issues suggests that:
1. Some cells may need to be rewritten
2. The logic flow needs to be verified
3. Test data and examples need to be validated

## Next Steps
1. Create a prioritized list of notebooks to fix
2. Manually review and repair each notebook
3. Ensure notebooks follow SciTeX best practices
4. Test execution after each fix
