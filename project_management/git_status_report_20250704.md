## Potential Unexpected Changes
- **API documentation files deleted**: 13 .rst files in docs/RTD/api/ have been deleted
- **Pre-commit config modified**: May affect development workflow
- **Build directory created**: docs/RTD/_build/ contains generated documentation

## Recent Commits
- fab3e7f fix: complete notebook cleanup per priority 10 requirements
- fc3319f fix: make notebooks papermill-compatible and fix multiple execution issues

## Available Plans

0. **Plan All**:
   Try to execute all the plans below in the order.
   If problem found, suggest next available plans again in the same manner.

1. **Plan A: Stage and commit documentation changes**
   ```bash
   git add docs/
   git add project_management/
   git add scripts/fix_notebook_*.py
   git add examples/*.ipynb
   git commit -m "docs: add guides and fix notebook indentation issues"
   ```

2. **Plan B: Push to origin/develop**
   ```bash
   git push origin develop
   ```

3. **Plan C: Create PR from origin/develop to origin/main**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "feat: complete notebook cleanup and documentation updates" --body "
   ## Summary
   - Completed Priority 10 notebook cleanup
   - Fixed notebook execution issues
   - Added documentation guides
   - Updated bulletin board with progress
   
   ## Changes
   - Removed all notebook variants and print statements
   - Fixed indentation and format issues
   - Created quickstart and coverage guides
   - Updated RTD documentation
   "
   ```

4. **Plan D: Review and address API docs deletion**
   ```bash
   # The deleted API docs might be important
   git checkout -- docs/RTD/api/
   # Or regenerate them if they were auto-generated
   ```

5. **Plan E: Selective commit (if Plan A is too large)**
   ```bash
   # Commit in smaller chunks
   git add examples/*.ipynb
   git commit -m "fix: resolve notebook indentation issues"
   
   git add docs/
   git commit -m "docs: add quickstart and coverage guides"
   
   git add project_management/
   git commit -m "docs: update project management reports"
   ```

## Recommendation
I recommend Plan D first to address the deleted API documentation files, then proceed with Plan E for cleaner commit history.
