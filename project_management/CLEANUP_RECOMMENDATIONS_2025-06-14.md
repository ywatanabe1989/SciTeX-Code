# Cleanup Recommendations - 2025-06-14

## Post-Test-Fix Cleanup Tasks

### 1. Python Cache Files
- **134 `__pycache__` directories** found
- **1,168 `.pyc` files** found
- Recommendation: Add these to .gitignore if not already present

### 2. Obsolete Test Files
- `tests/custom/old/` directory contains 51 failing tests
- These tests reference non-existent utilities and old mngs patterns
- Recommendation: Review and either update or remove

### 3. Temporary Files
- Check for and remove any temporary fix scripts created during debugging
- Clean up any test output directories

### 4. Documentation Cleanup
- Multiple similar reports in project_management/:
  - TEST_ERROR_REPORT_2025-06-14.md
  - FIXES_SUMMARY_2025-06-14.md
  - TEST_FIX_PROGRESS_REPORT_2025-06-14.md
  - FINAL_IMPORT_FIX_SUMMARY.md
- Recommendation: Consolidate into single comprehensive report

### 5. Code Quality Items
Based on advance.md, remaining minor issues:
- ~50 minor naming inconsistencies (non-critical)
- Some modules may still have circular import potential

### 6. Git Repository Cleanup
- Stage and commit the fixes
- Consider creating a tag for this milestone
- Update README if test status has changed

### 7. CI/CD Considerations
With tests now running:
- Set up GitHub Actions for continuous testing
- Add test coverage badges
- Configure pre-commit hooks

### Priority Actions
1. Add Python cache to .gitignore
2. Review/remove obsolete tests in tests/custom/old/
3. Commit the improvements
4. Set up basic CI/CD

This cleanup will polish the repository to production-ready quality as intended.
