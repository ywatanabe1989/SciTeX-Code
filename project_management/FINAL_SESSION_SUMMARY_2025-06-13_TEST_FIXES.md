# Test Fix Session Summary - 2025-06-13

## Session Objective
Fix all test failures to meet user requirement: **"until all tests passed, do not think it is ready to push"**

## Progress Made

### Test Import Fixes
- ✅ Fixed 596 test file imports from 'scitex' to 'mngs' namespace
- ✅ Fixed special case: gen_timestamp moved from str.\_gen_timestamp to reproduce module
- ✅ Fixed indentation issue in torch/test__nan_funcs.py
- ✅ Added missing 'benchmark' marker to pytest.ini

### Missing Export Fixes
- ✅ Fixed plt.color module: added bgra2rgba and rgba2bgra to __init__.py exports
- These functions existed in _colors.py but weren't being exported

### Test Results
- **IO Module**: 27/29 tests passing (2 skipped due to optional dependencies)
- **Torch Module**: 28/28 tests passing 
- **PLT Color Module**: 23/23 tests passing after export fixes
- **Gen Timestamp**: All tests passing after import path corrections

### Error Reduction
- Started with: 229 collection errors
- Current state: 224 collection errors
- Progress: 5 errors fixed

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Namespace Mismatch**: Tests are in `tests/scitex/` but source code is in `src/mngs/`
2. **Missing Exports**: Many functions exist in private modules but aren't exported in __init__.py files
3. **Module Relocations**: Some functions moved between modules (e.g., gen_timestamp)
4. **Import Path Issues**: Tests using incorrect import paths for private modules

## Remaining Work

### To achieve 100% test pass rate:
1. Fix remaining 224 collection errors
2. Systematically check all __init__.py files for missing exports
3. Consider either:
   - Renaming all test imports to use 'mngs' namespace, OR
   - Creating a scitex compatibility layer that imports from mngs

## Repository Status
- **Commits**: 102 ahead of origin/develop
- **Status**: NOT READY TO PUSH (per user requirement)
- **Requirement**: 100% test pass rate before pushing

## Recommendation
The main blocker is the namespace mismatch between tests (scitex) and source (mngs). A systematic approach is needed to either:
1. Update all test imports to use mngs namespace
2. Create scitex module that re-exports mngs functionality
3. Move source code to match test expectations

Without resolving this fundamental mismatch, achieving 100% test pass rate will be challenging.
