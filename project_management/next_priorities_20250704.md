**Agent**: cd929c74-58c6-11f0-8276-00155d3c097c

## Completed âœ…
- Priority 10: Notebook cleanup (all variants removed, print statements cleaned)
- Priority 1: Read the Docs setup (ready for deployment)
- Priority 1: Circular imports (resolved)
- Priority 1: GitHub Actions (fixed)

## Next Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Remaining Notebook Execution Issues (High Priority)
Based on previous reports, several notebooks still fail to execute:
- Kernel death issues in some notebooks
- API mismatches between notebooks and current implementation
- Need to ensure all 25 notebooks can run cleanly

### 2. Django Hosting Implementation (Priority 1)
- Guide already created: ./project_management/django_hosting_guide_20250704.md
- Recommended approach: Static files (Option 1)
- Waiting for implementation in Django project

### 3. Scientific Validity & Testing
- Validate statistical functions
- Ensure plotting accuracy
- Add more comprehensive tests

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Fix remaining ~50 minor naming issues
- Add missing docstrings
- Improve error handling

## Recommendation
The most logical next step is to fix the remaining notebook execution issues since:
1. We just cleaned up the notebooks
2. Having working examples is critical for users
3. It will help identify any remaining API issues in the codebase
