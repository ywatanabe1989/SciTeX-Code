# Read the Docs Setup - Completion Report

**Date**: 2025-07-04  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE & PUSHED

## Summary

Successfully set up Read the Docs documentation for SciTeX with full notebook integration.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Documentation Structure ✅
- Created comprehensive `docs/RTD/` directory
- Configured Sphinx with proper extensions
- Fixed API documentation recursive references

### 2. Notebook Integration ✅
- Converted 25+ Jupyter notebooks to RST format
- Integrated master tutorial index as centerpiece
- Created learning paths for different user types

### 3. Configuration ✅
- `.readthedocs.yaml` in repository root
- Fixed requirements.txt (sklearn → scikit-learn)
- Updated conf.py with correct paths

### 4. Branding ✅
- Updated to "Scientific tools from literature to LaTeX Manuscript"
- Enhanced README with documentation section
- Created getting started guide

### 5. Version Control ✅
- Committed all changes
- Pushed to origin/develop
- Ready for Read the Docs import

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.readthedocs.yaml`
- `docs/RTD/examples/index.rst`
- `docs/RTD/getting_started.rst`
- `docs/RTD/examples/*.rst` (25+ notebook conversions)

### Modified Files
- `docs/RTD/index.rst` - Updated with proper structure
- `docs/RTD/api/*.rst` - Fixed recursive references
- `README.md` - Added documentation section
- `.claude/commands/advance.md` - Updated progress

## Next Steps

1. **Import on Read the Docs**
   - Sign in to readthedocs.org
   - Import ywatanabe1989/SciTeX-Code
   - Documentation will build automatically

2. **Verify Build**
   - Check build logs
   - Confirm all notebooks render correctly
   - Test search functionality

3. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Configure custom domain (docs.scitex.ai)
   - Add version tags
   - Enable PDF/ePub downloads

## Known Issues

From bulletin board entry, there are notebook execution issues that need addressing:
- Bug in gen.to_01() dimension handling
- Missing functions in stats module
- Path expectation mismatch in notebooks

These don't affect documentation build but should be fixed for interactive notebook execution.

## Conclusion

The Read the Docs setup is complete and pushed. The documentation infrastructure is ready for automatic building and hosting. The previous build error ("Config file not found") is resolved as `.readthedocs.yaml` is now in the repository.
