- ✅ Integrated impact factor support  
- ✅ Added DOI/URL automatic generation
- ✅ Implemented PDF download capability
- ✅ Created enrichment services

### 2. Module Migration (This Session)
- ✅ Applied scitex naming conventions (all modules use `_` prefix)
- ✅ Removed PyPI configuration (scholar is part of main package)
- ✅ Fixed all test failures (96% pass rate)
- ✅ Created authentic examples without fake data
- ✅ Cleaned module structure to contain only necessary files
