# Progress Update - June 13, 2025

## Overview
Significant progress made on MNGS to SciTeX migration and critical bug fixes.

## Completed Work

### Milestone 1: Code Organization and Cleanliness
- âœ… Identified major structural issue: 180+ files missing in develop branch
- âœ… Created comprehensive file audit and missing files report
- âœ… Documented mngs â†’ scitex migration status

### Milestone 2: Naming and Documentation Standards
- âœ… Created Sphinx documentation framework (previous commits)
- âœ… Added comprehensive API reference documentation
- âœ… Documented GIF support investigation and findings

### Milestone 3: Test Coverage Enhancement
- âœ… Enhanced test coverage for multiple modules (previous work)
- âœ… Added import error handling to AI modules for better robustness
- ðŸ”„ Identified need for _save_modules test coverage

### Bug Fixes and Investigations
- âœ… **GIF Support Investigation**: 
  - Root cause: GIF was declared in dispatch table but never implemented
  - Resolution: Added full GIF support to scitex-initial branch
  - Supports PIL Image, Plotly figures, and Matplotlib figures

- âœ… **Missing Files Discovery**:
  - Found entire `src/mngs/io/_save_modules/` directory missing from develop
  - Affects save functionality for all file formats
  - Created action plan for restoration

## Current Blockers

1. **Critical: Missing _save_modules Directory**
   - 180+ files missing in develop branch
   - Requires merge from scitex-initial branch
   - Awaiting user approval for merge

2. **Repository Structure Confusion**
   - Repository still named mngs_repo
   - Package renamed from mngs to scitex in scitex-initial branch
   - Need clarity on final naming strategy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Merge scitex-initial into develop**
   - Restores all missing files
   - Includes GIF support fix
   - Resolves save functionality issues

### Short Term
1. Create comprehensive test suite for _save_modules
2. Resolve naming inconsistencies (mngs vs scitex)
3. Update documentation to reflect new structure

### Long Term
1. Complete migration to SciTeX branding
2. Achieve >80% test coverage goal
3. Create examples for new save functionality

## Metrics
- Commits added: 2 (AI error handling, documentation)
- Files documented: 5 new documentation files
- Issues resolved: 1 (GIF support)
- Issues discovered: 1 (missing 180+ files)

## Recommendations
1. **Urgent**: Approve and execute merge of scitex-initial into develop
2. **Important**: Decide on final repository/package naming
3. **Nice to have**: Add automated file integrity checks for future migrations
