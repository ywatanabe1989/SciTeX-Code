# Scholar Module Test Status Report

**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Module**: SciTeX Scholar  
**Overall Status**: Partially Working (107 passed, 37 failed, 15 errors)

## Summary

After fixing async refactoring issues in PDFDownloader, the Scholar module has:
- **Pass Rate**: 69% (107/159 tests)
- **PDFDownloader**: ✅ 100% passing (20/20)
- **Core Functionality**: Working but needs test updates

## Test Results by Component

### ✅ Fully Passing Components
1. **PDFDownloader** (20/20) - All async issues fixed
2. **Scholar init** (3/3) - Module imports working
3. **NA Reasons** (5/5) - Feature working correctly
4. **Papers basic operations** (most tests passing)

### ⚠️ Partially Failing Components

#### 1. Config Tests (9/17 failing)
- **Issue**: Missing `use_impact_factor_package` attribute
- **Cause**: Tests expect old attribute that was removed/renamed

#### 2. SearchEngines Tests (13/24 failing)  
- **Issue**: Methods changed from `search()` to `search_async()`
- **Cause**: Async refactoring not reflected in tests

#### 3. MetadataEnricher Tests (10/28 failing)
- **Issue**: Missing citation-related methods
- **Cause**: Methods were renamed/refactored

#### 4. Scholar Tests (15/20 errors)
- **Issue**: Mock config missing `google_scholar_timeout`
- **Cause**: Test mocks outdated

#### 5. Paper Tests (5/18 failing)
- **Issue**: Missing JCR_YEAR import, bibtex key generation
- **Cause**: Import location changed

## Root Causes

1. **Async Migration**: Many methods changed to async versions but tests not updated
2. **API Changes**: Some attributes/methods renamed or removed
3. **Mock Objects**: Test mocks don't match current class structures
4. **Import Changes**: Some constants moved to different modules

## Priority Fixes Needed

1. Update SearchEngine tests to use `search_async()`
2. Fix Config tests - check actual ScholarConfig attributes
3. Update Scholar test mocks with required attributes
4. Fix MetadataEnricher citation method names
5. Fix Paper test imports for JCR_YEAR

## Impact on Functionality

Despite test failures, the core Scholar functionality appears to be working:
- ✅ PDF downloads work (OpenAthens investigated, Lean Library implemented)
- ✅ Basic search and enrichment likely work
- ✅ Papers collection manipulation works
- ⚠️ Some edge cases may have issues

## Recommendation

The failing tests are mostly due to outdated test code rather than actual functionality issues. The module is likely usable but needs comprehensive test updates to match the current async API.
