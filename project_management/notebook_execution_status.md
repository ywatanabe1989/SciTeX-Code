# Notebook Execution Status Report

## Summary
Attempted to run example notebooks with papermill but encountered multiple issues that need to be addressed before notebooks can run successfully.

## Current Status
- ✅ Papermill installed and configured
- ✅ Improved path handling implemented in scitex.io module
- ✅ Notebook detection functionality implemented
- ❌ Notebooks still failing due to path mismatch and code issues

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Path Handling Mismatch
**Issue**: Notebooks expect files in current directory but scitex saves to `{notebook_name}_out/`
- Example: Notebook expects `io_examples/large_data.pkl`
- Actual location: `01_scitex_io_out/io_examples/large_data.pkl`

**Temporary workaround attempted**: Created symlinks but notebooks still fail

**Permanent solution needed**: Update all notebook code to use the new path convention

### 2. Circular Import Issue (Fixed)
**Issue**: Circular import between gen and io modules
**Fix**: Moved imports inside functions to break the cycle

### 3. Function Bugs

#### gen.to_01() dimension bug
```python
RuntimeError: Please look up dimensions by name, got: name = None.
```
The function expects `dim` parameter but gets `None` when called with numpy arrays

#### Missing stats functions
```python
AttributeError: module 'scitex.stats' has no attribute 'ttest_ind'
```
The stats module is missing standard statistical test functions

## Notebooks Tested
1. **01_scitex_io.ipynb** - Failed (path issue)
2. **02_scitex_gen.ipynb** - Failed (to_01 dimension bug)
3. **11_scitex_stats.ipynb** - Failed (missing ttest_ind)

## Next Steps
1. Fix the `gen.to_01()` dimension handling bug
2. Add missing statistical functions to stats module
3. Update notebook code to handle new path conventions
4. Run full test suite with papermill

## Recommendations
1. Consider backward compatibility mode for notebook paths
2. Add integration tests for notebook execution
3. Document the new path handling behavior clearly
