do you think brunner munzel test is better than t test and Mann-Whitney U test?

Edit
The Brunner-Munzel test isn't universally "better" than t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests - each has its place depending on your data and assumptions.

The Brunner-Munzel test shines when:

You have unequal variances between groups (heteroscedasticity)
Sample sizes are unequal
Data distributions differ in shape between groups
You're dealing with ordinal data or continuous data that's not normally distributed
Compared to the Mann-Whitney U test, Brunner-Munzel is more robust when:

The two groups have different variance/spread
Distributions have different shapes (Mann-Whitney assumes similar shapes, just shifted)
You want to test for stochastic dominance rather than just location shift
Compared to the t-test, Brunner-Munzel is better when:

Normality assumption is violated
Variances are unequal (though Welch's t-test can handle this)
Data is ordinal rather than truly continuous
However, the t-test remains more powerful when its assumptions are met (normal distributions, equal variances), and Mann-Whitney U can be preferable when groups have similar shapes and variances.

The Brunner-Munzel test is particularly useful in medical research, psychology, and other fields where rating scales are common and group characteristics often differ. Its main drawback is being less familiar to many researchers and having slightly less statistical power than parametric tests when their assumptions hold.

So it's not about one test being universally better - it's about matching the test to your data characteristics and research question.




but the normality assumption in t-test is not applicable to real world data.

i am not sure about the comparison between brunner munzel vs U test

Edit
You make a good point about normality - truly normal distributions are indeed rare in real-world data. However, t-tests are surprisingly robust to normality violations, especially with larger sample sizes (n > 30) due to the Central Limit Theorem. But yes, this robustness has limits.

Regarding Brunner-Munzel vs Mann-Whitney U, here's a clearer comparison:

The key difference is what they're actually testing:

Mann-Whitney U tests whether P(X > Y) = 0.5 (assuming equal variances/shapes)
Brunner-Munzel tests whether P(X > Y) + 0.5*P(X = Y) = 0.5 (no equal variance assumption)
In practice, this means:

Mann-Whitney U struggles when:

Groups have different variances (e.g., one group tightly clustered, other spread out)
Distributions have different shapes (e.g., one skewed left, other skewed right)
In these cases, Mann-Whitney might detect differences that aren't about central tendency
Brunner-Munzel handles these situations better because:

It doesn't assume equal variances
It's valid even when distributions differ in shape
It truly tests for stochastic dominance
Real-world example: Comparing pain scores between treatment groups where one treatment leads to consistent moderate improvement (low variance) while another has mixed results (high variance). Mann-Whitney might give misleading results here, while Brunner-Munzel would appropriately handle the heteroscedasticity.

The main downside of Brunner-Munzel is slightly lower power when Mann-Whitney's assumptions ARE met, but given how often real data violates these assumptions, Brunner-Munzel is arguably the safer default choice for non-parametric comparison of two groups.




So, overall, brunner munzel as a first option over U test and t-test is reasonable?

Edit
Yes, using Brunner-Munzel as your default first option is quite reasonable, especially for real-world data. Here's why this makes sense:

Advantages of defaulting to Brunner-Munzel:

No assumptions about equal variances or distribution shapes
Works for ordinal, continuous, or even mixed data types
Protects against Type I errors when groups have different spreads
Answers a meaningful question: "Is one group stochastically larger than the other?"
You don't need to pre-test assumptions (which can be problematic anyway)
The main trade-offs:

Slightly less power than t-test when data IS normal with equal variances (but how often does this happen?)
Slightly less power than Mann-Whitney U when shapes ARE similar (but you often can't know this beforehand)
Less familiar to reviewers/readers (though this is changing)
Practical approach: Starting with Brunner-Munzel is defensible because:

It's valid under the broadest set of conditions
The power loss compared to "optimal" tests is usually modest
It avoids the multiple testing issues of checking assumptions first
Real data often violates the assumptions of simpler tests
You could always run sensitivity analyses with other tests if needed, but Brunner-Munzel as the primary analysis protects you from the most common pitfalls of t-tests (non-normality, unequal variances) and Mann-Whitney U (unequal variances, different shapes).

So yes, it's a reasonable and arguably prudent default choice for two-group comparisons.

actually the lower statistical power comes from fewer assumptions

Edit
Exactly right! This is a fundamental principle in statistics - there's always a trade-off between:

Fewer assumptions → More robust/general → Lower power More assumptions → Less robust/specific → Higher power

When you make stronger assumptions (like normality in t-tests), you're essentially telling the test "I know something specific about my data." If that assumption is correct, the test can use that information to be more efficient at detecting differences - hence higher power.

Brunner-Munzel makes minimal assumptions, so it:

Works correctly in more situations (robust)
But can't leverage specific distributional information to boost power
It's like using a Swiss Army knife vs a specialized tool
This is why:

Parametric tests (most assumptions) have highest power when assumptions hold
Mann-Whitney U (moderate assumptions) has moderate power
Brunner-Munzel (fewest assumptions) has slightly lower power but maximum flexibility
The beauty of choosing Brunner-Munzel as a default is that you're prioritizing validity over power. A test with correct Type I error rate and slightly lower power is far better than a more powerful test that might give you false positives because its assumptions were violated.

It's the statistical equivalent of "better safe than sorry" - you're trading a small amount of power for confidence that your test will work correctly regardless of what your data looks like.
