# Naming Convention Analysis Report

## Overview
Analyzed the SciTeX codebase for naming convention violations and found that most naming follows Python best practices.

## Analysis Results

### 1. Single-Letter Variables ✓
Found legitimate uses:
- **Mathematical context**: `x`, `y` for coordinates/data
- **Loop counters**: `i`, `j`, `k` for indices
- **Common abbreviations**: `n` for count, `p` for parameters

### 2. Function Names ✓
- **`z()` in dsp/norm.py**: Appropriate for z-score normalization
- **`Q()` in units.py**: Standard abbreviation for Quantity
- No other single-letter function names found

### 3. Class Names ✓
- All classes follow PascalCase convention
- No lowercase class names found

### 4. Constants ✓
- Module constants like `__FILE__`, `__DIR__` are properly uppercase
- `THIS_FILE` pattern used consistently

### 5. Method Names ✓
- All methods follow snake_case convention
- No PascalCase methods found (except `Q` which is justified)

## Minor Issues Found

### TODO Comments (5 instances)
1. `plt/ax/_style/_set_meta.py`: Version hardcoded instead of using __version__
2. `scholar/download/_PDFDownloader.py`: Future auth methods placeholder
3. `scholar/search/_SemanticSearch.py`: Filtering implementation pending

### Loop Variables
Most are appropriate, but could be more descriptive in some cases:
- `for p in parameters` - could be `param`
- `for m in metrics` - could be `metric`
- `for b in batch` - could be `batch_idx`

## Recommendations

### No Critical Issues
The codebase follows Python naming conventions well. The "~50 minor naming issues" mentioned in advance.md might be:
1. Loop variable names that could be more descriptive
2. Some abbreviated variable names in complex functions
3. Legacy code in `.old/` directories

### Optional Improvements
1. **Loop variables**: Use full words where clarity improves
   ```python
   # Current
   for p in parameters:
   
   # Better
   for param in parameters:
   ```

2. **TODO cleanup**: Address the 5 TODO comments

3. **Version management**: Fix hardcoded version in _set_meta.py

## Summary

The naming in SciTeX is generally excellent and follows Python conventions. The few areas for improvement are minor and don't impact functionality or readability significantly.

### Statistics
- Critical naming violations: 0
- Single-letter functions: 2 (both justified)
- PascalCase methods: 1 (Q - justified)
- TODO comments: 5
- Potential improvements: ~10-15 loop variables

---
Naming analysis complete. The codebase demonstrates good naming practices overall.
