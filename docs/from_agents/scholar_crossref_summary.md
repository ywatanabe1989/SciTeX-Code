# Scholar Module - CrossRef Integration Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. CrossRef Search Engine Implementation
- ✅ Added `CrossRefEngine` class to `_SearchEngines.py`
- ✅ Full search functionality with query, limit, and year filtering  
- ✅ Proper date validation (fixed "None" date issue)
- ✅ Parses CrossRef API response into Paper objects
- ✅ Extracts citation counts, DOIs, abstracts, and metadata

### 2. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Added CrossRef to UnifiedSearcher with API key support
- ✅ Updated valid sources list to include 'crossref'
- ✅ Added CrossRef to default search sources in ScholarConfig
- ✅ Updated default_config.yaml with CrossRef documentation
- ✅ Scholar class passes crossref_api_key to UnifiedSearcher

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ Updated main README.md highlighting 5 search engines
- ✅ Added Scholar module to submodules table under Literature category
- ✅ Updated Scholar README.md with CrossRef in examples
- ✅ Added CrossRef to What's New section

### 4. Testing
- ✅ Verified CrossRef search returns results
- ✅ Tested year filtering works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed integration with other search engines

## User Question About Architecture

The user asked: "Do you think is it better to organize engines as separate files with consistent input/output, using base engine class?"

### Recommendation
Yes, this would be a significant improvement. I've created a detailed proposal at:
`docs/from_agents/scholar_engine_architecture_proposal.md`

Benefits:
- Better modularity (each engine ~150-200 lines vs 1100+ lines)
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Clear interface enforcement
- Simpler to add new engines

## Next Steps

1. **Refactor search engines** into separate files (if approved)
2. **Add tests** for CrossRef engine specifically  
3. **Document API rate limits** for each search engine
4. **Consider adding more search engines**:
   - Europe PMC
   - CORE (open access aggregator)
   - Microsoft Academic (if still available)
   - ORCID for author-based searches

## Current Architecture
```
_SearchEngines.py (1100+ lines)
├── SearchEngine (base class)
├── SemanticScholarEngine
├── PubMedEngine
├── ArxivEngine
├── CrossRefEngine (NEW)
├── GoogleScholarEngine
├── LocalSearchEngine
├── VectorSearchEngine
└── UnifiedSearcher
```

## Performance Considerations
- CrossRef rate limit: 0.5s between requests
- API key provides higher rate limits
- Results are sorted by relevance
- Deduplication handled by UnifiedSearcher
