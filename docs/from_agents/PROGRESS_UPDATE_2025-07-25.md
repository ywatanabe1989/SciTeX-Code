3. Deploy documentation to Read the Docs
4. Measure and improve code coverage
5. Complete CI/CD pipeline integration

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Previous | Current | Target |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Test Pass Rate | ~50% | ~75% | >95% |
| Working Notebooks | 2/26 | 5/5 essential | All 26 |
| Scholar Tests | Unknown | 71% (113/159) | >90% |
| CI/CD Pipeline | None | Basic | Full |
| Documentation | Scattered | Organized | Deployed |

## Modified Files Status

Current uncommitted changes in develop branch:
- Modified Scholar module files (improvements in progress)
- New development/debug scripts in .dev/
- Documentation updates
- New batch download example

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Commit Current Changes**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: Scholar module enhancements and batch download support"
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "feat: Version 2.0.0 - Major improvements and production readiness"
   ```

3. **Deploy Documentation**
