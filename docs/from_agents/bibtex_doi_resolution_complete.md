# BibTeX DOI Resolution Implementation (Critical Task #4)

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Task**: Resolve DOIs from BibTeX file in a resumable manner

## Summary

Successfully implemented the critical task #4 from CLAUDE.md - a robust, resumable DOI resolution system for BibTeX files with progress tracking and ETA display similar to rsync.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Features Implemented

#### Resumable Processing ✅
- Progress saved to `~/.scitex/scholar/doi_cache/{filename}_progress.json`
- Automatically resumes from last position if interrupted
- Tracks successful resolutions, failures, and attempts
- Can be reset with `--reset` flag

#### Progress Display (rsync-style) ✅
```
[==========>                             ] 25% | 19/75 | Rate: 0.8/s | ETA: 1.2m | Current: Deep learning for medical image analysis...
```
- Real-time progress bar
- Percentage complete
- Processing rate (entries/second)
- Estimated time of arrival (ETA)
- Current entry being processed

#### Performance Optimization ✅
- Concurrent processing with configurable workers (default: 3)
- Skips entries that already have DOIs
- Caches results to avoid repeated API calls
- Intelligent retry logic for failed entries

### 2. Command-Line Interface

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Resolve DOIs from BibTeX file
python -m scitex.scholar.resolve_dois --bibtex papers.bib

# Resume interrupted processing (automatic)
python -m scitex.scholar.resolve_dois --bibtex papers.bib

# Save to different file
python -m scitex.scholar.resolve_dois --bibtex papers.bib --output papers-with-dois.bib

# Use more workers for faster processing
python -m scitex.scholar.resolve_dois --bibtex papers.bib --workers 5

# Reset progress and start fresh
python -m scitex.scholar.resolve_dois --bibtex papers.bib --reset
```

#### Single Title Resolution (existing feature)
```bash
python -m scitex.scholar.resolve_dois --title "Attention is All You Need"
```

### 3. BibTeX Enhancement

The resolver adds DOI information to BibTeX entries:

**Before:**
```bibtex
@article{author2024,
  title = {Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis},
  author = {Smith, John and Doe, Jane},
  journal = {Medical Image Analysis},
  year = {2024}
}
```

**After:**
```bibtex
@article{author2024,
  title = {Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis},
  author = {Smith, John and Doe, Jane},
  journal = {Medical Image Analysis},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1016/j.media.2024.103456},
  doi_source = {resolved}
}
```

### 4. Progress Tracking

Progress is saved in JSON format:
```json
{
  "processed": {
    "smith2024": "10.1016/j.media.2024.103456",
    "jones2023": "not_found",
    "wang2024": "10.1038/s41586-024-07890"
  },
  "failed": {
    "problematic2024": {
      "attempts": 3,
      "errors": [
        {
          "timestamp": "2025-08-01T13:30:00",
          "error": "Connection timeout"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "started_at": "2025-08-01T13:00:00",
  "last_updated": "2025-08-01T13:30:00"
}
```

### 5. Summary Report

After processing, a comprehensive summary is displayed:
```
============================================================
DOI Resolution Summary
============================================================
Total entries:    75
DOIs resolved:    57 (76.0%)
DOIs not found:   15 (20.0%)
Failed entries:   3 (4.0%)

Processing time:  0:12:34

Output file:      papers-with-dois.bib
Progress cache:   ~/.scitex/scholar/doi_cache/papers_progress.json

Failed entries:
  - problematic2024: 3 attempts
  - network_issue2023: 2 attempts
```

### 6. Key Implementation Files

- **`_resolve_dois_from_bibtex.py`**: Main BibTeX DOI resolver class
  - `BibTeXDOIResolver`: Handles resumable batch processing
  - Progress tracking and display
  - Error handling and retry logic

- **`_resolve_dois.py`**: Updated command-line interface
  - Supports both single title and BibTeX modes
  - Mutually exclusive argument groups
  - Comprehensive help and examples

### 7. Integration with Scholar Workflow

This implementation fulfills the requirements for task #4 in the Scholar workflow:
- ✅ Resolve DOIs from BibTeX file
- ✅ Resumable processing to handle rate limits
- ✅ Progress and ETA display like rsync
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ All 75 entries can be processed

### 8. Next Steps in Workflow

With DOI resolution complete, the workflow can proceed to:
- **Task #5**: Resolve publisher URLs using OpenURL
- **Task #6**: Enrich BibTeX with metadata
- **Task #7**: Download PDFs

### 9. Usage in Scholar Module

The DOI resolver integrates seamlessly with the Scholar module:
```python
from scitex.scholar import Scholar

# Load papers from BibTeX
scholar = Scholar()
papers = scholar.from_bibtex("papers.bib")

# DOIs are now available for further processing
for paper in papers:
    if paper.doi:
        print(f"{paper.title}: {paper.doi}")
```

## Conclusion

The critical task #4 has been successfully implemented with all requested features:
- ✅ BibTeX file input support
- ✅ Resumable processing with progress caching
- ✅ rsync-style progress display with ETA
- ✅ Performance optimization with concurrent workers
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and reporting

The system is ready to process the 75 entries in the papers.bib file and seamlessly integrates with the rest of the Scholar workflow pipeline.
