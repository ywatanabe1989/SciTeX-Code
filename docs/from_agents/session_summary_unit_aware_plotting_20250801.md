# Session Summary: Unit-Aware Plotting Implementation

## Overview
This session focused on implementing comprehensive unit-aware plotting functionality for the SciTeX library to enhance scientific validity. The work was completed successfully with all tests passing and comprehensive documentation created.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Unit-Aware Plotting System (100% Complete) ✅
- **Created `UnitAwareMixin` class** (`src/scitex/plt/_subplots/_AxisWrapperMixins/_UnitAwareMixin.py`)
  - Automatic unit detection from Quantity objects
  - Unit tracking and display in axis labels
  - Automatic unit conversion with data scaling
  - Unit validation to prevent mismatches
  - Support for both Quantity objects and manual unit specification

- **Enhanced Units Module** (`src/scitex/units.py`)
  - Added electrical units: volt, millivolt, ohm, farad
  - Added common abbreviations (mV, mA, μF, etc.)
  - Improved unit lookup functionality

- **Integrated into AxisWrapper** (`src/scitex/plt/_subplots/_AxisWrapper.py`)
  - Added UnitAwareMixin to inheritance chain
  - Seamless integration with existing plotting functionality

### 2. Testing and Validation ✅
- **Created comprehensive test suite** (`.dev/test_unit_aware_plotting.py`)
  - 4 tests covering all major functionality
  - All tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Tests include:
    - Basic plotting with units
    - Unit conversion and scaling
    - Unit validation
    - Quantity object integration

### 3. Documentation and Examples ✅
- **Created Jupyter notebook example** (`examples/25_scitex_unit_aware_plotting.ipynb`)
  - RC circuit analysis demonstration
  - Comprehensive usage examples
  - Scientific validity best practices

- **Proposal document** (`.dev/unit_aware_plotting_proposal.py`)
  - Detailed API specification
  - Implementation roadmap
  - Design rationale

### 4. Additional Work Completed

#### Feature Request Investigation ✅
- **Notebook Path Handling Feature**: Discovered it was already implemented
  - Enhanced environment detection (`_detect_environment.py`)
  - Notebook path detection (`_get_notebook_path.py`)
  - Save function uses `{notebook}_out/` pattern
  - Updated feature request documentation to mark as completed

#### DSP Notebook JSON Issue ✅
- Investigated reported JSON formatting issue in DSP notebook
- Found that the issue was already fixed in commit e599553
- Validated that the notebook has correct JSON structure

## Technical Details

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Automatic Unit Tracking**: Units are preserved from input data and displayed in axis labels
2. **Unit Conversion**: Automatic scaling when units differ (e.g., ms → s)
3. **Quantity Integration**: Seamless support for SciTeX Quantity objects
4. **Validation**: Optional unit mismatch detection and warnings
5. **Flexible API**: Works with both explicit units and automatic detection

### Example Usage:
```python
import scitex as stx
import numpy as np

# Create data with units
time = stx.Quantity(np.linspace(0, 10, 100), stx.Units.millisecond)
voltage = stx.Quantity(np.sin(time.value), stx.Units.volt)

# Plot with automatic unit handling
fig, ax = stx.subplots()
ax.plot_with_units(time, voltage)
# Automatically displays: Time (ms) vs Voltage (V)
```

## Impact

This implementation significantly enhances the scientific validity of plots created with SciTeX by:
- Preventing unit-related errors in scientific publications
- Ensuring consistent unit display across plots
- Simplifying unit conversion workflows
- Maintaining data integrity throughout the plotting process
