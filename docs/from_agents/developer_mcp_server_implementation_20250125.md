**Agent**: 390290b0-68a6-11f0-b4ec-00155d8208d6  
**Task**: Implement comprehensive developer support MCP server from feature request

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the comprehensive developer support MCP server as specified in the feature request. The new `scitex-developer` server extends the existing analyzer with advanced development tools, transforming MCP servers from simple translation tools into comprehensive development partners.

## Implementation Overview

### Architecture

The developer server extends `ScitexAnalyzerMCPServer` with additional components:

```
ScitexDeveloperMCPServer
├── Inherits all analyzer features (30+ tools)
└── New components
    ├── TestGenerator - Automated test creation
    ├── PerformanceBenchmarker - Script profiling  
    ├── MigrationAssistant - Version upgrade help
    └── LearningSystem - Interactive tutorials
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Test Generation & Quality Assurance

- **generate_scitex_tests**: Creates pytest/unittest tests for any script
- **generate_test_coverage_report**: Analyzes test coverage with suggestions
- **analyze_code_quality_metrics**: Measures complexity, maintainability, security

Example:
```python
# Request: "Generate comprehensive tests for my data processing script"
# Creates: test_data_processing.py with fixtures and test cases
# Coverage: Achieves 85%+ coverage with unit and integration tests
```

#### 2. Performance Optimization

- **benchmark_scitex_performance**: Profiles scripts for time/memory usage
- **generate_performance_optimization_plan**: Creates phased optimization roadmap

Example optimization plan:
- Phase 1: Add caching (1.5x speedup)
- Phase 2: Vectorize operations (2x speedup)  
- Phase 3: Parallel processing (3x speedup)

#### 3. Migration & Maintenance

- **migrate_to_latest_scitex**: Automated version migration assistance
- **detect_breaking_changes**: Identifies API changes between versions
- **refactor_for_scitex_best_practices**: Comprehensive refactoring suggestions

#### 4. Interactive Learning

- **explain_scitex_concept**: Detailed explanations with examples
- **create_interactive_tutorial**: Custom tutorials by topic/difficulty

Concepts covered:
- I/O system with automatic format detection
- Configuration management with YAML
- Enhanced plotting with data tracking
