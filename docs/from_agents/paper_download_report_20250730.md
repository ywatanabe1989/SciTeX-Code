3. **Timeout**: Process timed out after 2 minutes during third paper download

### Files Downloaded
```
.dev/downloaded_pdfs/
├── 10.1002_hipo.22488.pdf (6.1 MB)
└── 10.1038_nature12373.pdf (0.3 MB)
```

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Downloads**: Run the script again to download remaining papers
2. **Enable OpenAthens**: Configure OpenAthens properly for better access to paywalled content
3. **Increase Timeout**: Consider increasing timeout for slow downloads
4. **Use ZenRows**: Once tested, integrate ZenRows for anti-bot bypass

## Code Used

The successful download was achieved using:
```python
downloader = PDFDownloader(
    download_dir=download_dir,
    use_translators=True,
    use_scihub=True,
    use_playwright=True,
    acknowledge_ethical_usage=True,
    max_concurrent=2
)

pdf_path = await downloader.download_pdf_async(
    identifier=doi,
    metadata={"doi": doi},
    force=False
)
```

## Next Steps

1. Run download script again for remaining 3 papers
2. Test with OpenAthens authentication enabled
3. Integrate ZenRows for handling anti-bot measures
4. Create a more robust batch download script
