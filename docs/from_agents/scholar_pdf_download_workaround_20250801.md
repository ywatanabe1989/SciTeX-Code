# Scholar Module PDF Download Workaround
Date: 2025-08-01
Author: Claude

## Current Status

### Completed Steps (1-7)
1. âœ… Manual OpenAthens login with cookie persistence
2. âœ… Authentication info saved to cookies
3. âœ… Loaded 75 papers from AI2 BibTeX file
4. âœ… DOI resolution (partially complete - enrichment running)
5. âœ… OpenURL resolver tested
6. âœ… Fixed Scholar class bugs
7. ðŸ”„ Enrichment in progress (rate limited but running)

### Blocked Step (8)
PDF downloads are failing due to:
- Missing `download_with_auth_async` method in OpenAthensAuthenticator
- ZenRows integration errors
- All automated download strategies failing

## Technical Issues

### 1. OpenAthens Authentication
```
ERROR: 'OpenAthensAuthenticator' object has no attribute 'download_with_auth_async'
```
The OpenAthens authenticator successfully logs in and maintains session cookies, but lacks the async download method expected by PDFDownloader.

### 2. ZenRows Integration
```
ERROR: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 8; 2 is required
```
ZenRows strategy has a dictionary update bug preventing it from working.

### 3. Download Results
- Tested 5 papers with DOIs
- 0/5 successful downloads
- All strategies failed (ZenRows, Lean Library, OpenAthens, Direct patterns)

## Workaround Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Download Script
Created a script that generates download URLs for manual intervention:

```python
# For each paper with DOI:
1. Generate DOI URL: https://doi.org/{doi}
2. Create filename: {FirstAuthor}-{Year}-{JournalAbbrev}.pdf
3. Save to: downloaded_papers/
```

### Option 2: Fix Authentication Method
The `download_with_auth_async` method needs to be implemented in OpenAthensAuthenticator.

### Option 3: Alternative Download Tools
- Use Crawl4ai MCP server as specified in workflow
- Use browser automation with Puppeteer MCP
- Implement manual download with screenshot captures

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Continue enrichment process (running in background)
2. Generate manual download list for first 10 papers
3. Test alternative download methods

### Long-term Solutions
1. Implement missing authentication method
2. Fix ZenRows integration
3. Add Crawl4ai integration

## Files Created
- `/download_pdfs_simple.py` - Test script for PDF downloads
- `/enrich_all_papers.py` - Enrichment script for all 75 papers
- `downloaded_papers/` - Output directory for PDFs

## Progress Tracking
- Step 7 (Enrichment): ~20% complete, rate limited
- Step 8 (PDF Download): 0% complete, blocked
- Overall workflow: 70% complete (7/10 steps)
