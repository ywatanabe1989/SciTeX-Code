# Scholar Module Refactoring Summary
**Date:** 2025-07-31
**Agent:** Claude

## Overview
Refactored the scholar module to remove obsolete files and fix import dependencies. Also addressed timeout issues in OpenURL resolver.

## Files Removed (using safe_rm.sh)

### Auth Directory
1. `_LeanLibraryAuthentication.py` - Not exported, not used anywhere
2. `_ZenRowsRemoteAuthenticator.py` - Not exported, not used anywhere  
3. `_CacheManager.py` - Not exported, functionality integrated into authenticators

### Browser Directory
1. `_TwoCaptchaHandler.py` - Not exported, not used anywhere
2. `_ZenRowsScrapingBrowser.py` - Not exported, not used anywhere

### Open_url Directory
1. `_OpenURLResolverWithScrapingBrowser.py` - Not exported, only self-referencing
2. `_OpenURLResolverWithZenRowsBrowser.py` - Not exported, only self-referencing

## Import Fixes

### EZProxyAuthenticator
- Removed `CacheManager` import (placeholder implementation doesn't need it)
- Added simple cache_dir attribute

### OpenAthensAuthenticator  
- Removed `CacheManager` import
- Integrated cache management directly into the class
- Fixed all references from `self.cache_manager.*` to `self.*`

### ShibbolethAuthenticator
- Removed `CacheManager` import (placeholder implementation doesn't need it)
- Added simple cache_dir attribute

### PDFDownloader
- Removed `LeanLibraryAuthenticator` import
- Set `self.lean_library_authenticator = None` for compatibility

## Additional Fixes

### OpenURLResolver Timeout
- Increased SAML redirect timeout from `random.uniform(1500, 3000)` to `15000` (15 seconds)
- This addresses the timeout errors seen with Nature and Science publishers

## Testing
- All imports verified working correctly
- No regressions found
- Removed classes correctly raise ImportError when accessed

## Files Still in Use
The following files were kept as they are actively used:
- `_CookieAutoAcceptor.py` - Used by BrowserMixin
- `_StealthManager.py` - Used internally by browser managers
- `_ZenRowsStealthyLocal.py` - Used by OpenURLResolver and PDFDownloader for stealth browsing
