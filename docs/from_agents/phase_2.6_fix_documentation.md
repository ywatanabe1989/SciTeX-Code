# Phase 2.6 Fix Documentation

## Problem
The PDF downloading workflow was missing proper handling for Phase 2.6: "Wait until final destination shown (intermediate redirect may exist)". Specifically, when using OpenURL resolver to access papers, the code would:

1. Navigate to the resolver URL
2. But NOT click on the "Available from Nature" link
3. And NOT wait for the final destination after redirects

## Solution Implemented

### Location
File: `./src/scitex/scholar/_PDFDownloader.py`
Method: `_try_openurl_resolver_async`

### Changes Made

1. **Added Publisher Link Detection (Phase 2.5)**
   - Searches for common publisher access links on resolver pages
   - Patterns include:
     - "Available from Nature"
     - "View full text at"
     - "Full Text from Publisher"
     - Direct publisher domain links (nature.com, springer.com, etc.)

2. **Implemented Click and Wait for Navigation (Phase 2.6)**
   - Uses `asyncio.gather` to simultaneously:
     - Click the publisher link
     - Wait for network idle state (up to 30 seconds)
   - Additional 3-second wait for JavaScript redirects
   - Logs intermediate redirects for debugging

3. **Added Cookie Consent Handling (Phase 2.7)**
   - After reaching final destination, handles cookie consent popups
   - Prevents these popups from blocking access to PDF

### Code Example

```python
# Phase 2.5: Find and click "Available from Nature" or similar link
publisher_link_selectors = [
    'a:has-text("Available from Nature")',
    'a:has-text("View full text at")',
    # ... more selectors
]

# Phase 2.6: Click link and wait for final destination
await asyncio.gather(
    publisher_link.click(),
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle', timeout=30000),
    return_exceptions=True
)

# Phase 2.7: Handle cookie consent at final destination
await self._handle_cookie_consent_async(page)
```

## Testing

Use the provided test script: `./test_phase_2.6_fix.py`

This script tests the specific query:
- "Addressing artifactual bias in large, automated MRI analyses of brain development"
- DOI: 10.1038/s41593-025-01990-7

## Expected Behavior

The logs should now show:
1. "Looking for publisher access links on resolver page..."
2. "Found publisher link: [selector] -> [URL]"
3. "Clicking publisher link and waiting for final destination..."
4. "Redirected from resolver to: [final URL]"
5. "Final destination: [URL]"
6. "Handling cookie consent if present..."

## Benefits

- Properly handles multi-step authentication flows
- Works with institutional OpenURL resolvers
- Handles intermediate redirects gracefully
- Manages cookie consent popups automatically
- Better logging for debugging authentication issues
