                                                   PDF Download
                                                         ↓
                                                    Validation
                                                         ↓
                                                 Database Storage
                                                         ↓
                                                 Semantic Search
```

### Storage Locations
```
~/.scitex/scholar/
├── auth/           # Authentication cookies
├── cache/          # API response cache
├── database/       # Paper metadata and indices
├── vector_db/      # Semantic search vectors
├── pdfs/           # Organized PDF files
└── progress/       # Resumable operation state
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```python
from scitex.scholar import Scholar

# Initialize
scholar = Scholar()

# Load and process papers
papers = scholar.load_bibtex("papers.bib")
papers = scholar.enrich_bibtex("papers.bib")

# Download PDFs
results = scholar.download_pdfs(papers)

# Search for similar papers
similar = scholar.search_similar("deep learning climate")
```

### Advanced Features
```python
from scitex.scholar.database import PaperDatabase
from scitex.scholar.search import SemanticSearchEngine

# Database organization
db = PaperDatabase()
db.import_from_papers(papers)
db.organize_pdf(entry_id, pdf_path, "year_journal")

# Semantic search
engine = SemanticSearchEngine(database=db)
engine.index_papers()
results = engine.search_by_text("transformer models")
```

### MCP Interface
```python
# Through Claude
await search_papers(query="machine learning", limit=20)
await enrich_bibtex(bibtex_path="papers.bib")
await download_pdfs_batch(dois=["10.1234/..."])
await semantic_search(query="deep learning climate")
```
