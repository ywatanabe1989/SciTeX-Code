# SSO Automation Test Summary

## Overview

Created comprehensive test suite for the SSO automation integration with 14 passing tests covering all major functionality.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Base Abstract Class Tests (2 tests)
- ✅ Cannot instantiate abstract BaseSSOAutomator directly
- ✅ Concrete implementations must implement all required methods

### 2. University of Melbourne Implementation (5 tests)
- ✅ Proper initialization with configuration options
- ✅ SSO page detection based on URL patterns
- ✅ Credential validation with environment variables
- ✅ Credential validation without environment variables
- ✅ Login flow with mocked browser page

### 3. SSO Automator Factory (3 tests)
- ✅ Creates Melbourne automator from various URLs
- ✅ Returns None for unknown institutions
- ✅ Creates automator from institution ID

### 4. OpenURL Resolver Integration (4 tests)
- ✅ Auto-detects institution from resolver URL
- ✅ Accepts manually configured SSO automator
- ✅ Detects SSO login pages correctly
- ✅ Handles SAML redirects with SSO automation

### 5. End-to-End Integration (1 test)
- ⏭️ Skipped - requires actual browser and credentials

## Key Features Tested

1. **Abstract Interface**: Ensures proper implementation contract
2. **Institution Detection**: Auto-detection from URLs
3. **Credential Management**: Environment variable handling
4. **Browser Automation**: Mock-based testing of login flows
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with OpenURL resolver

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all SSO tests
pytest tests/scitex/scholar/test_sso_automation.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/scitex/scholar/test_sso_automation.py::TestSSOAutomatorFactory -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/scitex/scholar/test_sso_automation.py --cov=scitex.scholar.sso_automations
```

## Test Results

```
======================== 14 passed, 1 skipped in 0.47s =========================
```

- **Pass Rate**: 100% (excluding integration test)
- **Coverage**: All major code paths tested
- **Performance**: Tests complete in under 0.5 seconds

## Next Steps

1. Add tests for additional institutions as they're implemented
2. Create integration tests with real browser (manual run)
3. Add performance tests for session persistence
4. Create tests for 2FA handling when implemented
