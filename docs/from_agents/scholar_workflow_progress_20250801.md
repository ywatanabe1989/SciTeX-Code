# Scholar Module Workflow Progress Report
Date: 2025-08-01
Author: Claude

## Overview
Progress report on implementing the Scholar module workflow for automated literature search and PDF download.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ‚úÖ BibTeX File Processing
- Located sample BibTeX file: `src/scitex/scholar/docs/papers.bib`
- Contains 75 papers total (worked with first 5 for testing)
- Created backup before enrichment: `papers.bib.bak`

### 2. ‚úÖ DOI Resolution
Successfully resolved DOIs for 4 out of 5 test papers:

| Paper | Title | DOI Found |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Quantification of Phase-Amplitude Coupling | ‚ùå No DOI found |
| 2 | Generative models, linguistic communication | ‚úÖ 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.07.005 |
| 3 | The functional role of cross-frequency coupling | ‚úÖ 10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.001 |
| 4 | Untangling cross-frequency coupling | ‚úÖ 10.1101/005926 |
| 5 | Measuring phase-amplitude coupling | ‚úÖ 10.1152/jn.00106.2010 |

### 3. üîÑ OpenURL Resolver Testing
- Fixed import error in `_OpenURLResolver.py`
- Configured with ZenRows proxy for Australian routing
- Ready for institutional access testing

## Current Status

### Active Work
- Testing OpenURL resolver with institutional authentication
- The resolver is configured to use ZenRows stealth browser with Australian proxy

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Rate Limiting**: Enrichment process hit rate limits when processing all 75 papers
2. **Import Error**: Fixed missing `asyncio` import in OpenURLResolver
3. **Authentication**: Need to complete OpenAthens login for full access

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete OpenURL resolver testing with one DOI
2. Set up batch PDF download for resolved papers
3. Implement PDF content verification

### Future Work
1. Database integration for paper organization
2. Semantic vector search implementation
3. Full workflow automation with error handling

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `.dev/test_scholar_workflow.py` - Workflow testing script
- `.dev/resolved_papers.json` - DOI resolution results (pending)
- Multiple download test scripts in `.dev/`

### Modified
- `src/scitex/scholar/open_url/_OpenURLResolver.py` - Fixed import issue

## Technical Details

### Configuration
```yaml
Scholar Configuration:
- PubMed Email: Configured
- Semantic Scholar API: Not set (using CrossRef fallback)
- OpenAthens: Enabled
- ZenRows: Configured with Australian proxy
```

### DOI Resolution Sources
1. CrossRef API (primary)
2. Semantic Scholar API (secondary)
3. PubMed (fallback)

## Recommendations

1. **Authentication**: Complete OpenAthens login for institutional access
2. **API Keys**: Consider adding Semantic Scholar API key to reduce rate limiting
3. **Batch Processing**: Implement resumable batch processing for large BibTeX files
4. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for network timeouts

## Summary
The Scholar module workflow is progressing well. We've successfully:
- Identified and processed the input BibTeX file
- Resolved DOIs for 80% of test papers
- Set up the infrastructure for OpenURL resolution
- Prepared for PDF download automation

The main remaining tasks are completing the authentication setup and implementing the PDF download pipeline.
