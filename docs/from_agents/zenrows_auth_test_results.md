# ZenRows Authentication Test Results

## Summary

I tested accessing the requested DOIs with authentication through ZenRows. Here are the findings:

### DOIs Tested
- `10.1038/nature12373` - Nature
- `10.1016/j.neuron.2018.01.048` - Neuron (Cell Press)
- `10.1126/science.1172133` - Science  
- `10.1073/pnas.0608765104` - PNAS

### Key Findings

1. **Authentication cookies cannot be passed through ZenRows proxy**
   - ZenRows uses its own proxy network that doesn't preserve session cookies
   - JavaScript cookie injection doesn't work as ZenRows executes JS in isolation
   - All requests appear as unauthenticated to publishers

2. **What we successfully captured**
   - Screenshots of paywall pages
   - HTML content showing "Access through your institution" prompts
   - Clear indication that institutional access is not working through ZenRows

3. **Technical Details**
   - ZenRows successfully bypasses Cloudflare and anti-bot measures
   - Returns full HTML content (420KB for Nature article)
   - Screenshots work perfectly (1920x1080 resolution)
   - BUT: No authenticated access to full text

### Example Results

For Nature article (`10.1038/nature12373`):
- Title captured: "Nanometre-scale thermometry in a living cell | Nature"
- HTML shows: "This is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution"
- No PDF links found
- Clear paywall indicators present

### Why Authentication Fails with ZenRows

1. **Proxy Isolation**: ZenRows routes through their proxy network, not your authenticated session
2. **Cookie Scope**: Authentication cookies are domain-specific and can't be transferred
3. **Security**: Publishers' authentication systems detect proxy usage

### Alternatives for Authenticated Access

1. **Local Browser with Playwright**
   - Use your actual browser session with authentication
   - Can access paywalled content with your institutional login
   - Example: `BrowserManager` class (not ZenRows)

2. **OpenURL Resolver**
   - Library proxy services might work better
   - The Ex Libris resolver showed promise but needs browser-based access

3. **Publisher APIs**
   - Some publishers offer APIs for institutional access
   - Would need separate implementation per publisher

### Conclusion

While ZenRows excels at:
- Bypassing CAPTCHAs and anti-bot measures
- Taking screenshots of any public page
- Handling JavaScript-heavy sites

It **cannot** provide authenticated access to paywalled academic content because:
- Authentication happens in your browser session
- ZenRows uses isolated proxy sessions
- Publishers explicitly block proxy access to licensed content

For accessing paywalled papers with institutional authentication, you need to use:
1. Local browser automation (Playwright without ZenRows)
2. Publisher-specific APIs with institutional credentials
3. Library proxy services designed for this purpose

The captcha handling integration is complete and working well, but it won't help with accessing paywalled content that requires authentication.
