# OpenAthens Authentication Countdown Removal

## User Request
"and no need to count 3 seconds for authentication"

## Solution Implemented

### What Was Changed
Removed the 3-second countdown from the OpenAthens authentication process in `_Scholar.py`.

### Before
```python
print("\nStarting in 3 seconds... (Press Ctrl+C to cancel)\n")

# Give user a brief moment to cancel if needed
try:
    import time
    for i in range(3, 0, -1):
        print(f"  {i}...", end='', flush=True)
        time.sleep(1)
    print("\n\nüåê Opening browser for authentication...")
```

### After
```python
print("\nüåê Opening browser for authentication...")
```

### Impact
- Authentication browser now opens immediately when needed
- No more waiting for countdown
- User can still cancel with Ctrl+C during the authentication process
- Cleaner, faster user experience

### File Modified
- `src/scitex/scholar/_Scholar.py` (lines 420-428)

### Testing
Created test script `test_no_countdown.py` which confirms:
- ‚úÖ Countdown code has been removed
- ‚úÖ Authentication proceeds immediately
- ‚úÖ No references to "3 seconds" or countdown loops remain

## Summary
The 3-second countdown has been successfully removed. When OpenAthens authentication is required, the browser will now open immediately without any delay.
