# SciTeX Scholar Authentication Architecture

## Summary

We've redesigned the PDF download system to properly separate **authentication** (providing access) from **discovery engines** (finding PDFs). This addresses the user's insight that "OpenAthens is not an engine" but rather an authentication layer.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Authentication Provider Framework

Created `_AuthenticationProviders.py` with:
- **Base class**: `AuthenticationProvider` defining the interface
- **Implemented**: `OpenAthensAuthentication` (fully working)
- **Placeholders**: `EZProxyAuthentication`, `ShibbolethAuthentication`, `LeanLibraryAuthentication`, `IPBasedAuthentication`
- **Manager**: `AuthenticationManager` to handle multiple providers

Each provider implements:
```python
async def is_authenticated() -> bool
async def authenticate() -> bool  
async def get_authenticated_session() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### 2. Enhanced Zotero Translator Integration

The key insight: **Zotero Translators + Authentication = Reliable PDF Downloads**

- Zotero knows exactly where PDFs are on 600+ publisher sites
- Authentication provides access to paywalled content
- Combined, they can reliably find and download PDFs

Implementation:
```python
# 1. Get auth session
auth_session = await auth_manager.get_authenticated_session()

# 2. Pass cookies to Zotero translator
if auth_session and auth_session.get('cookies'):
    await browser_context.add_cookies(auth_session['cookies'])

# 3. Run translator on authenticated page
result = await zotero_runner.run_translator(url)
```

### 3. Refactored Download Flow

**Old flow** (treating OpenAthens as a strategy):
```
Try strategies in sequence:
1. Direct patterns
2. OpenAthens ‚Üê Wrong! It's not a discovery method
3. Zotero translators
4. Playwright
5. Sci-Hub
```

**New flow** (auth + discovery separation):
```
1. Ensure authentication (if needed)
   - Check all registered auth providers
   - Use first authenticated one
   - Get session cookies/headers

2. Try discovery engines WITH auth session:
   - Direct URL patterns (fastest)
   - Zotero translators (most reliable) 
   - Playwright scraping (fallback)
   - Sci-Hub (last resort)
```

### 4. Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Easy to add new auth methods or discovery engines
2. **Reliability**: Zotero translators can access authenticated content
3. **Flexibility**: Any auth method works with any discovery engine
4. **Future-proof**: Clean interfaces for expansion

### 5. Graceful Error Handling

For unimplemented auth methods:
```python
class EZProxyAuthentication(AuthenticationProvider):
    async def authenticate(self, force: bool = False) -> bool:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "EZProxy authentication not yet implemented. "
            "EZProxy support is planned for a future release. "
            "Please use OpenAthens authentication for now."
        )
```

This clearly communicates what's available and what's coming.

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Complete**:
- OpenAthens authentication with browser-based login
- Zotero Translator Runner with 600+ site support
- Authentication Provider framework
- Design for auth/discovery separation

üîß **In Progress**:
- Updating PDFDownloader to use new architecture
- Testing OpenAthens + Zotero on major publishers

üìù **Future**:
- EZProxy authentication
- Shibboleth/SAML authentication  
- Lean Library browser extension
- IP-based authentication enhancements

## Example Usage

```python
from scitex.scholar import Scholar

# Initialize with authentication
scholar = Scholar(openathens_enabled=True)

# Ensure authenticated (opens browser if needed)
scholar.ensure_authenticated()

# Download papers - automatically uses auth + Zotero
papers = scholar.search("quantum computing")
results = scholar.download_pdfs(papers)
```

## Technical Details

The system now properly handles:
1. **Authentication persistence**: Cookies saved encrypted to disk
2. **Session sharing**: Multiple processes can share auth session
3. **Live verification**: Can check if session is still valid
4. **Automatic browser opening**: Prompts or auto-opens for auth
5. **Enhanced PDF discovery**: Special selectors for authenticated pages

## Conclusion

By separating authentication from discovery, we've created a more robust and extensible system. OpenAthens provides the access, Zotero Translators know where to find PDFs, and together they enable reliable academic PDF downloads.
