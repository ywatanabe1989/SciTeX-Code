# SciTeX Documentation Setup Complete

## Overview
The SciTeX documentation has been successfully prepared for Read the Docs hosting. This document summarizes the setup and structure.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Incorporated Master Index Notebook**
- The comprehensive `00_SCITEX_MASTER_INDEX.ipynb` has been integrated into the documentation
- Created `docs/RTD/examples/index.rst` that references all 25+ tutorial notebooks
- Provides multiple learning paths for different user types (beginners, data scientists, ML engineers, researchers)

### 2. **Converted Notebooks to RST**
- Created `convert_notebooks_to_rst.py` script to convert Jupyter notebooks to RST format
- Successfully converted most notebooks (some had validation errors but stub files were created)
- Each RST file includes links to view the notebook on GitHub

### 3. **Documentation Structure**
```
docs/RTD/
├── index.rst                 # Main documentation index
├── getting_started.rst       # Quick start guide
├── installation.rst          # Installation instructions
├── examples/
│   ├── index.rst            # Examples overview with learning paths
│   ├── 00_SCITEX_MASTER_INDEX.rst
│   ├── 01_scitex_io.rst
│   └── ... (all 25+ notebooks)
├── api/                     # API documentation
├── modules/                 # Module guides
└── requirements.txt         # Documentation dependencies
```

### 4. **Read the Docs Configuration**
- Created `.readthedocs.yaml` in project root with:
  - Python 3.11 support
  - Sphinx configuration pointing to `docs/RTD/conf.py`
  - PDF and ePub format support
  - Comprehensive requirements installation

### 5. **Updated Branding**
- Updated all documentation to reflect that SciTeX stands for "Scientific tools from literature to LaTeX Manuscript"
- This better captures the full scope from literature search to publication

### 6. **Enhanced README**
- Added comprehensive documentation section with links to:
  - Online Read the Docs (when live)
  - Local notebook tutorials
  - Key learning paths

## Next Steps for Hosting

1. **Create Read the Docs Account**
   - Go to https://readthedocs.org/
   - Sign up/login with GitHub account

2. **Import Project**
   - Click "Import a Project"
   - Select the SciTeX repository
   - Read the Docs will automatically detect `.readthedocs.yaml`

3. **Configure Settings**
   - Set default branch (main/master)
   - Enable PDF/ePub builds if desired
   - Configure custom domain if available (e.g., docs.scitex.ai)

4. **Build Documentation**
   - Trigger first build
   - Check build logs for any errors
   - Documentation will be available at https://scitex.readthedocs.io/

## File Locations

- **Configuration**: `/.readthedocs.yaml`
- **Documentation Root**: `/docs/RTD/`
- **Examples**: `/docs/RTD/examples/`
- **Conversion Script**: `/docs/RTD/convert_notebooks_to_rst.py`

## Features Included

1. **Master Tutorial Index** - Comprehensive guide to all SciTeX features
2. **Learning Paths** - Organized by skill level and domain
3. **Interactive Examples** - 25+ Jupyter notebooks with explanations
4. **API Documentation** - Auto-generated from docstrings
5. **Search Functionality** - Built-in search across all documentation

The documentation is now ready for hosting on Read the Docs!
