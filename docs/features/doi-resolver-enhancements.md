# DOI Resolver Enhancements Summary

## What We Learned and Implemented

### Key Insights from Processing 75 Papers

1. **Multi-source Resolution is Essential**
   - Direct DOI extraction from URLs: 14 papers
   - Semantic Scholar API: 24 papers  
   - PubMed API: 5 papers
   - Title-based search: 4 papers
   - **Total: 53/75 papers (70.7%)**

2. **Rate Limiting Challenges**
   - Semantic Scholar: 429 errors require delays (1-2 seconds)
   - PubMed: 0.3 second delay recommended
   - CrossRef: Most generous, minimal delays needed

3. **URL Patterns Matter**
   - `doi.org/` - Direct extraction
   - `semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:` - API lookup required
   - `ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/` - PubMed ID to DOI conversion
   - `sciencedirect.com` - Needs API key (not implemented)
   - `ieeexplore.ieee.org` - Needs subscription (not implemented)

## Enhancements Made to scitex.scholar

### 1. Enhanced DOI Resolver (`doi_resolver.py`)

```python
# New method for URL-based resolution
def resolve_from_url(self, url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Resolve DOI from URL using multiple strategies:
    1. Direct DOI extraction
    2. Semantic Scholar API
    3. PubMed API
    """
```

### 2. Updated Scholar Module (`scholar.py`)

```python
# Enhanced _fetch_missing_fields to try URL first
if paper.pdf_url:
    doi = self._doi_resolver.resolve_from_url(paper.pdf_url)
    if doi:
        paper.doi = doi
        logger.info(f"  âœ“ Found DOI from URL: {doi}")
```

### 3. Enhanced Batch Resolver (`batch_doi_resolver.py`)

```python
# Added URL resolution to batch processing
url = paper.get('url') or paper.get('pdf_url')
if url:
    doi = self._resolver.resolve_from_url(url)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from scitex.scholar import Scholar

scholar = Scholar()

# Single paper enhancement
papers = scholar.enhance_bibtex("papers.bib")
# Now automatically tries URL resolution before title search
```

### Direct DOI Resolution
```python
# From URL
doi = scholar._doi_resolver.resolve_from_url(
    "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:220603864"
)
# Returns: "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.07.005"

# From title
doi = scholar.resolve_doi(
    "The functional role of cross-frequency coupling",
    year=2010
)
# Returns: "10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.001"
```

## Remaining Challenges

1. **ScienceDirect (5 papers)** - Requires Elsevier API key
2. **IEEE (8 papers)** - Requires institutional subscription
3. **No URL (4 papers)** - Need manual search or better title matching
4. **Some papers simply don't have DOIs** - Pre-digital era or conference papers

## Performance Optimizations

- Batch processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
- LRU caching for repeated lookups
- Intelligent rate limiting per source
- Parallel processing with progress bars

## Files to Remove

The `doi_resolver/` directory can now be removed as all functionality has been integrated into the main scholar module.
