# General
## Multi Agent System
Working with other agents using the bulletin board: ./project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md

## SciTeX Guidelines
See ./docs/to_claude/guidelines/python/*SCITEX*.md

## No try-error as much as possible
Please do not use try-error as much as possible as it is difficult for me to find problems. At least, warn error messages.

## Working Directory
- Note that you are automatically cd backed to `./` (this project root) by each iteration
-----

# This project, SciTeX-Code

## Error/Warning handling
Use ./scitex_repo/src/scitex/errors.py

## Scholar module
The scholar module should be simplified and organized
