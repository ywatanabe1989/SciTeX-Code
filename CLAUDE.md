Working with other agents using the bulletin board, ensure all tests passed.

If errors found, determine the root cause and fix it.

We have moved from mngs to scitex. Use scitex all the time.

scitex is `~/proj/SciTeX-Code/src/scitex`
Old scitex repositories would be `~/proj/scitex_repo/src/scitex` or `~/proj/.claude-worktree/scitex_repo/src/scitex` but do never use them. Just use `~/proj/SciTeX-Code/src/scitex`

Please do not use try-error as much as possible as it is difficult for me to find problems. At least, warn error messages.
