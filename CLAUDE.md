## Multi Agent System
Working with other agents using the bulletin board: ./project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md

## MNGS is obsolete
We have renamed mngs to scitex. Use scitex all the time.

## No try-error as much as possible
Please do not use try-error as much as possible as it is difficult for me to find problems. At least, warn error messages.

## Current Priority: ipynb as examples
- [ ] Run the example notebooks
- [ ] Note that the environment is /home/ywatanabe/proj/scitex_repo/.env

## Allow me to create read the docs
- [ ] Host in Read the Docs
- [ ] Host in https://scitex.ai (our django app)


## Python Env
Python env is ./.env
All codes are expected run from the root of this repository `.`
When cd to different location, it is automatically deactivated.


## For circular importing issues
- [ ] Check importing orders
- [ ] Import modules in functions (lazy import)
