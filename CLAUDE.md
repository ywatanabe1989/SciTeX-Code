## Scholar Migration (Current Top-Most Priority)
- [ ] Naming convensions for scitex as in other modules ./src/scitex/* should be applied to newly migrated ./src/scitex/scholar module as well
- [ ] scitex_repo is just a symlink to SciTeX-Code:
  - [ ] /home/ywatanabe/proj/scitex_repo -> /home/ywatanabe/proj/SciTeX-Code
- [ ] Implement tests for the migrated scholar module as a scitex pip package
- [ ] Implement examples for the migrated scholar module as a scitex pip package
  - [ ] Also implement examples in jupyter notebooks (although i am not sure about it, it may be useful when rendered in github)
- [ ] NEVER USE DEMO OR FAKE DATA FOR ENSURING CREDIBILITY

## Multi Agent System
Work with other agents using the bulletin board: ./project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md

## MNGS is obsolete
We have renamed mngs to scitex. Use scitex all the time.

## No try-error as much as possible
Please do not use try-error as much as possible as it is difficult for me to find problems. At least, warn error messages.
