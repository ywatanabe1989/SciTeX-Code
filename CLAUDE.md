Working with other agents using the bulletin board.

Current top-most priority lies in MCP trainslation/reversetranslation servers construction.

See ./docs/to_claude/guidelines/python/*SCITEX*.md
See ./docs/from_user/scitex_translation_mcp_servers.md

Please do not use try-error as much as possible as it is difficult for me to find problems. At least, warn error messages.
