## ipynb as examples
- [ ] Add ipynb for examples for various modules

## Current Priority: MCP Translation Servers
Current top-most priority lies in MCP translation/reverse-translation servers construction.

See ./docs/to_claude/guidelines/python/*SCITEX*.md
See ./docs/from_user/scitex_translation_mcp_servers.md

## Multi Agent System
Working with other agents using the bulletin board: ./project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md

## MNGS is obsolete
We have renamed mngs to scitex. Use scitex all the time.

## No try-error as much as possible
Please do not use try-error as much as possible as it is difficult for me to find problems. At least, warn error messages.
