## üìà Coverage by Publisher

| Publisher | Papers | Downloaded | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|
| Scientific Reports | 10 | 9 | 90% |
| Frontiers | 8 | 8 | 100% |
| IEEE | 14 | 0 | 0% (no subscription) |
| Nature (subscription) | 2 | TBD | Via Zotero |
| Elsevier | 3 | TBD | Via Zotero |
| Others | 29 | TBD | Various |

## üîß Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **WSL-Windows Communication**
   - Zotero WSL ProxyServer integration
   - Connection at ywata-note-win.local:23119

2. **Authentication Handling**

3. Verify PDF quality and completeness

### Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced Automation**
   - Selenium/Playwright for browser control
   - Better input blocking mechanisms
   - Automatic retry on failures

2. **Expanded Coverage**
   - Fix MDPI download patterns
   - Add more publisher-specific handlers
   - Implement proxy authentication

3. **System Integration**
   - Integrate with Scholar library system
   - Add metadata enrichment
   - Create citation network analysis

## üìÅ Deliverables

### Scripts and Tools
- 20+ Python scripts in `.dev_pac/`
- Automated batch processing system
- Status tracking and reporting
- Zotero integration tools

### Documentation

## Project Summary

The PAC collection PDF download project successfully created an automated system for downloading academic papers using institutional access. While not all papers could be downloaded automatically due to publisher restrictions and technical limitations, the system provides a solid foundation for future academic paper collection efforts.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed a manual process that would take hours into an automated system that processes papers in batches, achieving 34.6% coverage of accessible papers with minimal user intervention.
