## 🔧 Scripts Created

### Download Scripts
- `download_with_proper_tabs.py` - Tab navigation with Ctrl+numbers
- `download_with_ctrl_tab.py` - Sequential tab navigation
- `parallel_download_smart.py` - Parallel downloads with deduplication
- `batch_download_linux_zotero.py` - Batch processing

### Utility Scripts
- `sync_zotero_to_scholar.py` - Sync Zotero → Scholar library
- `verify_pdf_content.py` - PDF content verification
- `check_pdf_details.py` - Detailed status checking
- `interactive_tab_test.py` - Tab switching verification

### Installation Scripts
- `install_zotero.sh` - Linux Zotero installation

## 📈 Progress Summary

### Before Session
- 18 PDFs (34.6% coverage)

### After Session
- 21 PDFs (40.4% coverage)
- **+3 new PDFs**
- **+5.8% coverage increase**

## 🚧 Remaining Challenges

### Papers Not Downloaded (31)
- Nature subscription papers (require manual steps)
- Elsevier papers (complex authentication)
- MDPI papers (URL pattern issues)
- Conference proceedings (varied access)

### IEEE Papers (14)
- No institutional subscription
- Cannot be downloaded

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Linux Zotero works well in WSL** - Direct connection, no proxy needed
2. **Tab navigation critical** - Ctrl+numbers more reliable than Ctrl+Tab
3. **Duplicate detection essential** - Same paper downloaded 7 times initially
4. **Content verification important** - All PDFs confirmed as valid papers

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Manual download for high-priority papers
2. Check Zotero Web Library for additional options
3. Request missing papers through interlibrary loan

### Future Improvements
1. Implement semantic vector search (Step 10)
2. Better SSO handling
3. Publisher-specific download strategies
4. Automated retry mechanisms
