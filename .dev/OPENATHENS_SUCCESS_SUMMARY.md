### Working Process Demonstrated

1. **Title → DOI Resolution**
   - Successfully searched for the paper by title
   - Found the DOI through PubMed and CrossRef searches
   - Verified exact match of the title

2. **DOI → PDF Download**
   - Used the DOI to download the PDF
   - OpenAthens authentication worked seamlessly
   - PDF downloaded through institutional access (not Sci-Hub)

### Key Fixes Implemented

1. **Import Errors** - Fixed function names in `__init__.py`
2. **Async Handling** - Fixed event loop issues in `_Scholar.py`
3. **Method Names** - Corrected async method calls throughout
4. **Search Function** - Fixed `search()` → `search_async()` method call

### Usage Instructions

```bash
# Set environment variables
export SCITEX_SCHOLAR_OPENATHENS_EMAIL='your.email@institution.edu'
export SCITEX_SCHOLAR_OPENATHENS_ENABLED=true

# Python usage
from scitex.scholar import Scholar

scholar = Scholar()
papers = scholar.search("your search query")
scholar.download_pdfs(papers)  # Will use OpenAthens automatically
```
