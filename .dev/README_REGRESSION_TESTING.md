# Regression Testing System

## 🎯 Purpose
Ensure that breakthrough implementations (invisible browser, PDF classification, screenshot integration) never break as we expand to new journals and features.

## 🚨 Critical Rule: NO REGRESSIONS
**Always run regression tests before:**
- Adding new journal support
- Modifying core browser functionality
- Changing PDF detection logic
- Updating classification rules
- Any major code changes

## 📋 Test Suite Overview

### 1. Pre-Commit Quick Check (`pre_commit_regression_check.py`)
**When to run:** Before every commit
**Duration:** ~30 seconds
**Purpose:** Verify core functionality isn't broken

```bash
python .dev/pre_commit_regression_check.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Core imports work
- ✅ Invisible browser initializes
- ✅ PDF classification works 
- ✅ Screenshot integration ready

### 2. Comprehensive Regression Suite (`regression_test_suite.py`)
**When to run:** Before major releases, weekly, after significant changes
**Duration:** ~5-10 minutes
**Purpose:** Full end-to-end testing

```bash
python .dev/regression_test_suite.py
```

**What it tests:**
- 🎭 Invisible browser + dimension spoofing
- 🤖 Bot detection bypass
- 🔍 PDF detection and classification
- 📸 Screenshot capture
- 📊 Integration between all components

## 📊 Test Results Interpretation

### Exit Codes:
- `0`: ✅ All tests passed - safe to deploy
- `1`: 🚨 Critical failure - deployment blocked
- `2`: ⚠️ Non-critical issues - deploy with caution

### System Status:
- **HEALTHY**: All breakthroughs working perfectly
- **DEGRADED**: Minor issues, core functionality intact
- **CRITICAL_FAILURE**: Core functionality broken

## 🧪 Test Cases (Current)

### Baseline Test: Science.org Article
- **URL**: `https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao0702`
- **Expected**: 1 main PDF, 3 total PDFs, Atypon Journals translator
- **Status**: CRITICAL (must pass for system to be functional)

### Future Test Cases (To Add):
- Nature articles
- Springer articles  
- Wiley articles
- arXiv papers
- Edge cases and error conditions

## 🔄 Adding New Test Cases

When adding support for a new journal:

1. **Add test case to `REGRESSION_TESTS`**:
```python
{
    "name": "Nature Example",
    "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/example",
    "doi": "10.1038/example",
    "expected_main_pdfs": 1,
    "expected_total_pdfs": 2,
    "expected_translator": "Nature",
    "critical": True  # Set to True for core functionality
}
```

2. **Run full regression suite**:
```bash
python .dev/regression_test_suite.py
```

3. **Verify no regressions in existing tests**

4. **Only commit if ALL tests pass**

## 🛡️ Protection Against Common Regressions

### Browser Functionality:
- ✅ Invisible mode still working
- ✅ Dimension spoofing still effective
- ✅ Bot detection still bypassed
- ✅ Authentication still working

### PDF Detection:
- ✅ Classification accuracy maintained
- ✅ Main vs supplementary distinction preserved
- ✅ Expected PDF counts for known articles
- ✅ Translator selection working

### Integration:
- ✅ Screenshots still captured
- ✅ Files saved to correct locations
- ✅ Error handling still robust
- ✅ Performance within acceptable bounds

## 📈 Monitoring and Alerts

### Automated Checks:
- Run pre-commit check on every commit
- Run full suite weekly (scheduled)
- Run full suite before releases
- Alert team on any failures

### Manual Checks:
- Test with new journal types
- Verify after major dependency updates
- Check after browser version changes
- Validate after authentication changes

## 🚀 Best Practices

1. **Never skip regression tests** - they catch critical issues early
2. **Add tests for new functionality** - expand coverage as system grows
3. **Fix regressions immediately** - don't let them accumulate
4. **Document expected behaviors** - make test expectations clear
5. **Version control test results** - track degradation over time

## 🔧 Integration with Development Workflow

### Daily Development:
1. Make code changes
2. Run `python .dev/pre_commit_regression_check.py`
3. Only commit if check passes

### Before Major Changes:
1. Run `python .dev/regression_test_suite.py`
2. Verify all existing functionality
3. Make changes
4. Run regression suite again
5. Only proceed if no regressions introduced

### Adding New Journals:
1. Add new test case
2. Implement journal support
3. Run full regression suite
4. Verify both new and existing functionality
5. Commit only if all tests pass

## 🎯 Success Metrics

The regression testing system is successful when:
- ✅ Zero critical functionality breaks during expansion
- ✅ New journal additions don't break existing journals
- ✅ Performance remains stable across changes
- ✅ User experience (invisible operation) is preserved
- ✅ Team confidence in system stability is high
