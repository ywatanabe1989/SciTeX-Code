# Browser Closing Fix Summary

## The Problem
The browser was closing immediately after clicking "University of Melbourne" because:

1. **Bad Success Detection**: The code was checking for `'my.openathens.net' in current_url` which was TRUE on the login page itself!
2. **Auto-fill Issues**: The auto-fill might have been triggering navigation or other issues
3. **No SSO Tracking**: The code didn't verify that you actually went through the login process

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic URL Check
**Before:**
```python
'my.openathens.net' in current_url and 'sso.unimelb.edu.au' not in current_url,
```
This fired when you were still on the login page!

**After:**
Only checks for specific success pages:
- `my.openathens.net/account`
- `my.openathens.net/app`

### 2. Disabled Auto-fill
- Removed automatic email filling
- Users must type email manually
- This prevents any auto-fill related issues

### 3. Added SSO Tracking
- Now tracks if you've visited an SSO page
- Only considers login successful if:
  - Success URL is detected AND
  - You've been to an SSO page OR
  - 30+ seconds have passed

### 4. Better Debugging
- Shows current URL every 10 seconds
- Logs when SSO pages are detected
- More detailed progress messages

## Testing the Fix

Run the debug script:
```bash
python .dev/openathens_tests/debug_browser_closing.py
```

## Expected Behavior Now

1. Browser opens at MyAthens
2. You manually type your email
3. Click "University of Melbourne"
4. Browser navigates to sso.unimelb.edu.au
5. **Browser STAYS OPEN** âœ…
6. You complete login
7. Browser redirects back to OpenAthens
8. Only THEN does browser close

## If It Still Closes Early

Please note:
- Exactly when it closes
- What URL is shown
- Any error messages

The debug script will show all URL checks in real-time to help identify any remaining issues.
