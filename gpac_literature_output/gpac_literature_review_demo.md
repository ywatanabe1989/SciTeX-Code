## Executive Summary

Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) is a key mechanism in neural oscillations where the phase of a low-frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude of a higher-frequency oscillation. This literature review covers foundational PAC methods, GPU acceleration techniques, and recent advances relevant to the gPAC project.

## Implementation Insights for gPAC

Based on this literature review, key considerations for gPAC include:

1. **Algorithm Selection**: The Modulation Index (MI) method by Tort et al. (2010) remains the gold standard for PAC computation.

2. **GPU Optimization**: Recent work shows 100x+ speedups are achievable with proper memory management and parallelization.

3. **Real-time Processing**: GPU implementations enable real-time PAC analysis for multi-channel recordings.

4. **Validation**: Compare results with established tools like TensorPAC to ensure accuracy.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Start with Tort et al. (2010) for PAC fundamentals
2. Review Canolty & Knight (2010) for theoretical background
3. Study recent GPU papers for implementation strategies
4. Examine Hulsemann et al. (2019) for method comparisons
